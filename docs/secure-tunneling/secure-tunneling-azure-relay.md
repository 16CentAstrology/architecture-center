Secure Tunneling with Azure Relay enables users to establish secure, bidirectional TCP connections to edge devices, without making significant changes to the firewall or network configuration on the edge. This example scenario shows how to implement secure tunneling with Azure Relay using a simulated device.

### Workflow

The following workflow demonstrates how a user can access a web server that is running on a remote device in a private network which corresponds to the above diagram:

1. The user triggers an Orchestrator Function to initiate a connection with a device specified in the request payload.
2. The Orchestrator invokes a direct method to the device via IoT Hub.
    - Direct methods are synchronous, follow a request-response pattern and are meant for communications that require immediate confirmation of their result (within a user-specified timeout).
3. The target device runs a web server. Upon initiation of a connection, it runs a Remote Forwarder for the port the web server is running on via [Azure Relay Bridge](https://github.com/Azure/azure-relay-bridge) and starts listening to an [Azure Relay Hybrid Connection](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-relay/relay-hybrid-connections-protocol) of the same name.
4. Upon successful response, the Orchestrator provisions and/or starts an Azure Container Instance (ACI) that runs a Local Forwarder via Azure Relay Bridge configured to connect to the same Azure Relay Hybrid Connection.
5. The ACI connects to the Azure Relay Hybrid Connection and exposes a public endpoint.
6. When the connection is established, the user can access the web server that is running on the remote device by going to the ACI's fully qualified domain name (FQDN) in their browser.

### Components

- [Azure Relay](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-relay/relay-what-is-it) enables you to securely expose services that run in your corporate network to the public cloud without opening a port on your firewall, or intrusive changes to your corporate network infrastructure.
- [Azure IoT Hub](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-hub/iot-concepts-and-iot-hub) acts as a central message hub for communication between an IoT application and its attached devices.
- [Azure Container Registry](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-registry/container-registry-intro) allows you to build, store, and manage container images and artifacts in a private registry for all types of container deployments.
- [Azure Container Instance](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-instances/container-instances-overview) offers the fastest and simplest way to run a container in Azure.
- [Azure Functions](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/sql-database) is a serverless solution that allows you to write less code, maintain less infrastructure, and save on costs in Azure.
- [Resource Groups](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/manage-resource-groups-portal) is a logical container for Azure resources.  We use resource groups to organize everything related to this project in Azure.

### Alternatives

- You can use the [Azure Web PubSub](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-web-pubsub/overview) which is a real-time messaging web applications that uses WebSockets and the publish-subscribe pattern in lieu of Azure Relay Service.
- You can use a custom WebSocket bidirectional connection from cloud to edge devices which may require more overhead and an "always on" connection.

## Scenario details

When devices are installed at remote locations and protected by firewalls, the users who need to access them for troubleshooting or other operational tasks often need to be present on-site or connected to the same local network as the device.

Secure Tunneling enables users to establish secure, bidirectional connections to edge devices, without making significant changes to the firewall or network configuration on the edge.

### Potential use cases

- Accessing Sensor Devices in Hospitals
  - A technician at a medical device company needs the ability securely access their sensor devices on demand, located hundreds of miles away behind a hospitalâ€™s firewall to troubleshoot and resolve an issue. Instead of having the technician travel to the hospital to respond to the incident, increasing resolution time and operational costs
- Smart building
  - System integrators in smart building scenario need to securely access the local web servers built in the remote devices over public internet to configure the device settings improving their operational efficiencies.

## Deploy this scenario

There is a sample deployment with a simulated device of the Secure Tunneling with Azure Relay on [GitHub](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/secure-tunneling-azure-relay). This sample enables communication between the user and device using HTTP but any protocol that sits above the TCP stack, such as SSH or RDP, can be supported.
