Azure Cognitive Service for Language is a cloud-based service that provides Natural Language Processing (NLP) features for understanding and analyzing text. Use this service to help build intelligent applications using the web-based Language Studio, REST APIs, and client libraries.

- **A Language resource** - Choose this resource type if you only plan to use natural language processing services, or if you want to manage access and billing for the resource separately from other services
- **A Cognitive Service resource** - Choose this resource type if you plan to use the Language service in combination with other cognitive services, and you want to manage access and billing for these services together.

The following table helps summarize the API service based on your processing needs

At a high Level you can think of Language API's to be categorized as follows

1. **Language Service** -Azure Language service provides several Natural Language Processing (NLP) features to understand and analyze text. Language service unifies Text Analytics, QnA Maker, and LUIS. These features can either be:
    - Pre-configured, which means the AI models that the feature uses are not customizable. You just send your data, and use the feature's output in your applications.
    - Customizable, which means you'll train an AI model using our tools to fit your data specifically.

2. **Azure Open AI Service**-Azure OpenAI Service provides REST API access to OpenAI's powerful language models including the GPT-3, Codex and Embeddings model series. These models can be easily adapted to your specific task including but not limited to content generation, summarization, semantic search, and natural language to code translation. Users can access the service through REST APIs, Python SDK, or our web-based interface in the Azure OpenAI Studio

3. **Translator Service** -Translator Service falling under Language API's provides Text-To-Text API's but this too involves language detection and conversion

4. **QnA Maker** - QnA Maker is a cloud-based Natural Language Processing (NLP) service that allows you to create a natural conversational layer over your data.
