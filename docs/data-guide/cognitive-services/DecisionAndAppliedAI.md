# Different Types of Decision API & Applied AI Services

Azure Cognitive Service for Decision is a cloud-based service that provides Natural Language Processing (NLP) features to provide recommendations for informed and efficient decision-making. They help with making smart decisions faster.

Azure Applied AI Services combine Azure Cognitive Services, specialized AI, and built-in business logic to provide ready-to-use AI solutions for frequently encountered business scenarios. One such service, Azure Cognitive Search, is a cloud search service with built-in AI capabilities.

## Service categories

There are several resource categories for these API services. A few of them are as follows:

1. [Azure Bot Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/products/bot-services/) - Azure Bot Service provides an integrated development environment for building conversational AI bots with no code needed through integration with Power Virtual Agents. Power Virtual Agents is available as both *a standalone web app*, and as *a discrete app within Microsoft Teams*.
2. [Anomaly Detector](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/anomaly-detector/overview) - Anomaly Detector ingests *time-series data of all types* and selects the best anomaly detection algorithm. The Anomaly Detector API enables you to monitor and detect abnormalities in your time series data without having to know machine learning . It uses univariate and multivariate APIs to monitor data over time.You can use it for either *batch validation or real-time inference*.
3. [Personalizer](https://azure.microsoft.com/products/cognitive-services/personalizer/) - Azure Personalizer is a cloud-based service that helps your applications choose the **best content item to show your users**. Personalizer's ability to select the best content item is based on the contextual information it receives. Personalizer uses *reinforcement learning* to select the best item (action) based on collective behavior and reward scores across all users. Actions are the content items, such as news articles, specific movies, or products.
4. [Content Moderator](/azure/cognitive-services/content-moderator/) - Content Moderator is a service that checks text, image, and video content for material that is potentially offensive, risky, or otherwise undesirable.
    - **Text Moderation** - Scans text for offensive content, sexually explicit or suggestive content, profanity, and personal data. Can use both pre-built or custom models
    - **Image Moderation** - Scans images for adult or racy content, detects text in images with the Optical Character Recognition (OCR) capability, and detects faces.Can use both pre-built or custom models
    - **Video Moderation** - Scans videos for adult or racy content and returns time markers for said content.Only supports in-built models as of today
5. [Azure Applied Services](/azure/applied-ai-services/what-are-applied-ai-services) - These services allow you to unlock the value of data by applying AI into their key business scenarios. These services are built on top of the AI APIS of Azure Cognitive Services. [Azure Cognitive Search](/azure/applied-ai-services/what-are-applied-ai-services#azure-cognitive-search) is one of the key Applied AI Services.

## Key considerations

- **Type of Data:** Text/Image/Video
- **Processing Mechanism:** Batch/Real-Time
- **Algorithm Used:** Pre-built/Custom

The following flow chart guides you in choosing the Decision/Open-AI service based on your processing needs

## Common Use Cases

1. **Azure Bot Service**
  Some of the ways that Power Virtual Agents bots have been used include:
    - Sales help and support issues
    - Opening hours and store information
    - Employee health and vacation benefits
    - Common employee questions for businesses

2. **Anomaly Detector**
  Some common use cases for Anomaly Detector include:
    - **Detect anomalies in your streaming data** by using previously seen data points to determine if your latest one is an anomaly.
    - **Detect anomalies in your an entire data series at one time.** This operation generates a model using your entire time series data, with each point analyzed with the same model.
    - **Detect any trend change points** in your an entire data series at one time. This operation generates a model using your entire time series data, with each point analyzed with the same model.

3. **Personalizer**
  Some common use cases for Personalizer are:
    - Use Case

4. **Content Moderator**
The service is capable of scanning *text, image, and video* content for potential risky, offensive, or undesirable aspects

5. **Applied OpenAI Services**
Azure Cognitive Services with task-specific AI, built-in business logic, programming, orchestration and customization to bring you ready-to-deploy AI solutions. Common use cases include
    - [Content Filtering](/azure/cognitive-services/openai/concepts/content-filter)
    - [Embeddings](/azure/cognitive-services/openai/concepts/understand-embeddings)
