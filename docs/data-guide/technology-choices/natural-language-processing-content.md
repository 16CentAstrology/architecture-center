Natural language processing (NLP) has many applications, such as sentiment analysis, topic detection, language detection, key phrase extraction, and document categorization.

Specifically, you can use NLP to:

- Classify documents, for example, labeling them as sensitive or spam.
- Conduct subsequent processing or searches with NLP outputs.
- Summarize text by identifying entities in the document.
- Tag documents with keywords, utilizing identified entities.
- Conduct content-based search and retrieval through tagging.
- Summarize a document's key topics using identified entities.
- Categorize documents for navigation utilizing detected topics.
- Enumerate related documents based on a selected topic.
- Assess text sentiment to understand its positive or negative tone.

With advancements in technology, NLP can not only be used to categorize and analyze text data, but also to enhance interpretable AI functions across diverse domains. The integration of Large Language Models (LLM) significantly enhances NLP's capabilities. LLMs like GPT and BERT can generate human-like, contextually aware text, making them highly effective for complex language processing tasks. They complement existing NLP techniques by handling broader cognitive tasks, which improve conversation systems and customer engagement, especially with models like [Databricks' Dolly 2.0](https://github.com/databrickslabs/dolly).

## Relationship and differences between language models and NLP

NLP is a comprehensive field encompassing various techniques for processing human language. In contrast, language models are a specific subset within NLP, focusing on deep learning to perform high-level language tasks. While language models enhance NLP by providing advanced text generation and understanding capabilities, they aren't synonymous with NLP. Instead, they serve as powerful tools within the broader NLP domain, enabling more sophisticated language processing.

## Develop NLP pipelines

For the execution order of an NLP pipeline, Spark NLP follows the same development concept as traditional Spark ML machine learning models, applying specialized NLP techniques.

:::image type="content" source="../images/spark-natural-language-processing-pipeline.png" alt-text="Diagram that shows N L P pipeline stages, such as document assembly, sentence detection, tokenization, normalization, and word embedding." border="false":::

The core components of a Spark NLP pipeline are:

- **DocumentAssembler**: A transformer that prepares data by converting it into a format that Spark NLP can process. This stage is the entry point for every Spark NLP pipeline. DocumentAssembler reads either a `String` column or an `Array[String]`, with options to preprocess the text using `setCleanupMode`, which is off by default.

- **SentenceDetector**: An annotator that identifies sentence boundaries using predefined approaches. It can return each detected sentence in an `Array`, or in separate rows when `explodeSentences` is set to true.

- **Tokenizer**: An annotator that divides raw text into discrete tokensâwords, numbers, and symbolsâoutputting these as a `TokenizedSentence`. The Tokenizer is non-fitted and uses input configuration within the `RuleFactory` to create tokenizing rules. Custom rules can be added when defaults are insufficient.

- **Normalizer**: An annotator tasked with refining tokens. Normalizer applies regular expressions and dictionary transformations to clean text and remove extraneous characters.

- **WordEmbeddings**: Lookup annotators that map tokens to vectors, facilitating semantic processing. You can specify a custom embedding dictionary using `setStoragePath`, where each line contains a token and its vector, separated by spaces. Unresolved tokens default to zero vectors.

Spark NLP leverages Spark MLlib pipelines, with native support from [MLflow](https://mlflow.org), an open-source platform that manages the machine learning lifecycle. MLflow's key components include:

- **MLflow Tracking**: Records experimental runs and provides robust querying capabilities for analyzing outcomes.

- **MLflow Projects**: Enables the execution of data science code on diverse platforms, enhancing portability and reproducibility.

- **MLflow Models**: Supports versatile model deployment across different environments through a consistent framework.

- **Model Registry**: Provides comprehensive model management, storing versions centrally for streamlined access and deployment, facilitating production-readiness.

MLflow is integrated with platforms such as Azure Databricks but can also be installed in other Spark-based environments to manage and track your experiments. This integration allows the use of the MLflow Model Registry for making models available for production purposes, thus streamlining the deployment process and maintaining model governance.

By using MLflow alongside Spark NLP, you can ensure efficient management and deployment of NLP pipelines, addressing modern requirements for scalability and integration while supporting advanced techniques like word embeddings and large language model adaptations.
