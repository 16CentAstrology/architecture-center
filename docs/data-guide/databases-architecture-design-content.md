This article provides an overview of the Azure database solutions described in Azure Architecture Center.

Azure Database solutions include both traditional Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) and big data solutions.

RDBMS workloads include online transaction processing (OLTP) and online analytical processing (OLAP).
Data from multiple sources in the organization might be consolidated into a data warehouse. You might use an extract, transform, and load (ETL) process to move and transform the source data.

A big data architecture is designed to handle the ingestion, processing, and analysis large or complex data.
Big data solutions typically involve a large amount of non-relational data, which traditional RDBMS systems aren't well suited to store.
This type of database is referred to as *Not only SQL* or *NoSQL*.

## Learn about databases on Azure

If you're new to databases on Azure, the best place to learn more is with Microsoft Learn, a free, online training platform.
You'll find videos, tutorials, and hands-on learning for specific products and services.
Microsoft Learn offers learning paths based on your job role, such as developer or data analyst.

[You can browse Azure data modules](/learn/browse/?products=azure&terms=database) or use this Learning Path to understand [Azure SQL fundamentals](/learn/paths/azure-sql-fundamentals).

Here are some Learn modules you might find useful:

- [Choose a data storage approach in Azure](/learn/modules/choose-storage-approach-in-azure)
- [Design your migration to Azure](/learn/modules/design-your-migration-to-azure)
- [Deploy Azure SQL Database](/learn/modules/deploy-azure-sql-database)
- [Explore Azure database and analytics services](/learn/modules/azure-database-fundamentals)
- [Secure your Azure SQL Database](/learn/modules/secure-your-azure-sql-database)

## Path to production

INTRO TEXT

To learn about resources for gathering data from multiple sources and how to and apply data transformation within the data pipeline, see [Extract, transform, and load (ETL)](../data-guide/relational-data/etl.yml).

To learn about Online analytical processing (OLAP), which organizes large business databases and supports complex analysis, see [Online analytical processing](../data-guide/relational-data/online-analytical-processing.yml).

A *non-relational database* does not use the tabular schema of rows and columns. For more information, see [Non-relational data and NoSQL](../data-guide/big-data/non-relational-data.yml).

To learn about designing a system that scales well as data grows, see [Build a scalable system for massive data](../data-guide/scenarios/build-scalable-database-solutions-azure-services.yml).

A big data architecture can handle ingestion, processing, and analysis of data that is too large or complex for traditional database systems. For more information, see [Big data architectures](../data-guide/big-data.yml).

In a big data architecture, you might need an analytical data store that serves processed data in a structured format that can be queried using analytical tools. For more information, see [Choose an analytical data store in Azure](../data-guide/technology-choices/analytical-data-stores.yml).

To learn about data lakes, which hold a large amount of data in its native, raw format, see [Data lakes](../data-guide/scenarios/data-lake.yml).

A hybrid cloud is an IT environment that combines public cloud and on-premises datacenters. For more information, see [Extend on-premises data solutions to the cloud](../data-guide/scenarios/hybrid-on-premises-and-cloud.yml).

Azure Cosmos DB is a fully managed NoSQL database service for modern app development. For more information, see [Azure Cosmos DB resource model](../cosmos-db/account-databases-containers-items.yml).

Azure Databricks is a fast, powerful Apache Sparkâ€“based analytics service for big data analytics and AI solutions. For more information, see [Monitoring Azure Databricks](../databricks-monitoring.yml).

To learn about the options for transferring data to and from Azure, see [Transfer data to and from Azure](../data-guide/scenarios/data-transfer.yml).
