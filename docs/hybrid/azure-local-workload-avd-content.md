The diagram above provides a high-level overview of the Azure Virtual Desktop for Azure Local solution. Summarily, here are the key elements in the visual above:

1. **User Device Initiates Connection**
   - User devices (either on-premises or remote) run the Azure Virtual Desktop client and initiate a connection to the Azure Virtual Desktop service in Azure.

2. **User Authentication via Microsoft Entra ID**
   - The Azure Virtual Desktop service in Azure interacts with [Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure Active Directory)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-sg/security/business/identity-access/microsoft-entra-id) to authenticate the user and perform a token exchange during login. 

   - **Hybrid Identity Synchronization**: A hybrid identity sync occurs between the on-prem AD DS (Active Directory Domain Services) server and the cloud-based Microsoft Entra ID, ensuring that user identities are synchronized and available for both local authentication (for session hosts on Azure Local) and cloud access. Note that this step operates continuously in the background to keep the on-premises AD DS and Microsoft Entra ID in sync.

   - **Session Host Connects to On-Prem AD DS**: The selected Azure Virtual Desktop session host connects to the on-premises AD DS server for user credential validation and applies any necessary group policies to configure the user's environment appropriately.

3. **Azure Virtual Desktop Agent Communication**
   - The Azure Virtual Desktop agent installed on the session host VM communicates with the Azure Virtual Desktop service in Azure to manage session brokering, handle user sessions, and provide metering and diagnostics data.

4. **Azure Arc Agent's Infrastructure Management**
   - The Azure Arc agent running on the session host VM provides additional governance, monitoring, and lifecycle management services for the underlying infrastructure on the Azure Local cluster.

5. **User Profile Storage with FSLogix**
   - Microsoft recommends using [FSLogix containers](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fslogix/tutorial-configure-profile-containers) with Azure Virtual Desktop to manage and roam user profiles and personalization. These profiles are preferably stored on a dedicated NAS/SMB file share off the Azure Local cluster or within the Storage Spaces Direct (S2D) pool on the Azure Local cluster, allowing for efficient profile management and quick load times during user sessions.

# Workload Design Considerations

In building out an Azure Virtual Desktop for Azure Local solution, there are several key design elements to consider - workload types, user profile management, and session types.

## Azure Virtual Desktop Workload Types

Session host virtual machines in an Azure Virtual Desktop for Azure Local environment can accommodate a wide range of workload types, each with specific resource requirements. To assist in estimating the optimal sizing for your virtual machines, the following table presents examples of various [workload categories](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/remote/remote-desktop-services/virtual-machine-recs).

| Workload Type | Example Users                 | Example Apps                                                                                         |
|---------------|-------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Light         | Users doing basic data entry tasks | Database entry applications, command-line interfaces                                                 |
| Medium        | Consultants and market researchers | Database entry applications, command-line interfaces, Microsoft Word, static web pages               |
| Heavy         | Software engineers, content creators | Database entry applications, command-line interfaces, Microsoft Word, static web pages, Microsoft Outlook, Microsoft PowerPoint, dynamic web pages, software development |
| Power         | Graphic designers, 3D model makers, machine learning researchers | Database entry applications, command-line interfaces, Microsoft Word, static web pages, Microsoft Outlook, Microsoft PowerPoint, dynamic web pages, photo and video editing, computer-aided design (CAD), computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) |

Please note that the workload types (light/medium/heavy/power) are indicative. We recommend you use simulation tools and industry benchmarks such as [LoginVSI](https://www.loginvsi.com/) to test your deployment with both stress tests and real-life usage simulations. Additionally, the information provided herein is based on point-in-time hardware data from solution builders and the latest Azure Local OS specifications. Sizing estimates may change over time due to changes in these factors.

## User Profiles and Storage

In Azure Virtual Desktop, managing user profiles and storage efficiently is pivotal for ensuring a seamless user experience. A user profile contains data elements about the individual, including configuration information like desktop settings, persistent network connections, and application settings.

[**FSLogix**](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-desktop/fslogix-profile-containers) is Microsoftâ€™s recommended solution for profile management in virtual desktop environments, designed to simplify and enhance user experience. It provides a robust and scalable approach for handling user profiles, ensuring fast login times and consistent user experience across sessions. [FSLogix uses profile containers](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fslogix/overview-what-is-fslogix) to store user profiles in Virtual Hard Disks (VHD) files located either on the Azure Local cluster itself or on a separate Azure or SMB-compatible file share. This method isolates user profiles, preventing conflicts and ensuring a personalized experience for each user, while also enhancing security and performance by maintaining profile independence. Additionally, FSLogix integrates seamlessly with Azure Virtual Desktop, optimizing the management and performance of user profiles in both single and multi-session environments.

When deploying Azure Virtual Desktop for Azure Local, FSLogix can be installed in one of two configurations to effectively manage user profiles:

### 1. Separate File Share

1. **Location**: FSLogix profiles can be stored on a dedicated file share within your on-premises environment. This file share can be hosted on an existing file server, network-attached storage (NAS), or a dedicated storage solution configured to serve the Azure Local cluster.
2. **Benefits**: Using a separate file share allows for centralized and scalable profile management. This approach is ideal for larger environments where centralizing profile storage ensures easier management and scalability.
3. **Considerations**: Network performance and latency are crucial. The file share must be highly accessible with minimal latency to ensure quick login times and seamless user experience. Ensuring robust network infrastructure is essential to support this setup.
4. **Recommendation for Large Deployments**: For organizations looking to scale beyond on-premises storage capacities, cloud-based storage solutions like [Azure Files](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/files/storage-files-introduction) or [Azure NetApp Files](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-netapp-files/azure-netapp-files-introduction) can be leveraged. These options provide high availability, robust performance, and simplified management, while alleviating storage constraints on the Azure Local cluster. They can also offer better scalability and flexibility compared to local on-prem file shares.

### 2. Same Azure Local Cluster

1. **Location**: FSLogix can be installed directly on the same Azure Local cluster that hosts the Azure Virtual Desktop infrastructure. The profile containers can be stored on the cluster's storage.
2. **Benefits**: This setup benefits from the high performance and low latency of local storage resources, which can enhance user experience by providing faster access to profile data. It also simplifies the deployment architecture by consolidating resources.
3. **Considerations**: While this approach offers simplicity and performance benefits, it might limit scalability compared to using a separate file share. It is more suitable for smaller deployments or environments where the Azure Local clusterâ€™s storage capacity and performance can handle the additional load without impacting other workloads. Note that leveraging this option will increase the Azure Local storage requirements on the hardware specifications.

## Session Types

In Azure Virtual Desktop, user sessions can be classified into single-session and multi-session modes, each offering different performance and user experience options:

- **Single-Session**: Each virtual machine (VM) hosts one user session, effectively providing a dedicated environment. This is similar to a traditional virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI) model where each user has their own desktop experience. Single-session is ideal for workloads that demand high performance, custom configurations, or applications that do not work well in shared environments.

- **Multi-Session**: A single VM hosts multiple user sessions simultaneously. This is optimized for cost-efficiency and scalability, where resources like CPU, memory, and storage are shared across users. Multi-session is suited for scenarios where users need access to standard applications or lighter workloads, like task workers or shared workstations, as it consolidates resources across many users.

### Considerations Between Session Types

Running single-session Azure Virtual Desktop for Azure Local can be resource-intensive, as it requires dedicated resources for each individual user. In contrast, Windows 10/11 multi-session allows multiple users to share the same virtual machine (VM) and its resources, making it a far more efficient option. Given that Windows 10 and 11 multi-session is available exclusively through Azure Virtual Desktop, it offers a compelling advantage in both cost savings and user experience. Leading with Windows 10/11 multi-session enables organizations to maximize their infrastructure by supporting more users per VM, reducing overall resource consumption while delivering a familiar, high-quality desktop experience.

The following section outlines the key factors that organizations should consider when selecting between single or multi-session environments.

### 1. Cost Savings

- **Single-Session Environment**:
  - Each user gets a dedicated virtual machine (VM).
  - Ensures consistent performance without resource competition.
  - Requires provisioning VMs for peak individual user demand.
  - Significantly increases resource requirements per user.

- **Multi-Session Environment**:
  - Multiple users share a single VM's resources.
  - Dynamically allocates resources based on current user needs.
  - Optimizes resource usage, reducing demand per user.
  - Increases user density on each node, leading to cost savings.
  - Potential for minor performance variability, but efficiencies generally outweigh this.

### 2. Enhanced User Experience

- **Single-Session Environment**:
  - Provides complete performance isolation between users.
  - Ideal for consistent performance needs and resource-intensive applications.
  - Eliminates impact of one user's activities on another's experience.

- **Multi-Session Environment**:
  - Maintains software isolation but may have hardware resource contention.
  - Offers a familiar Windows 10/11 desktop environment.
  - Balances high-quality experience for typical office tasks and general applications with lower costs.

### 3. User Customization

- **Single-Session Environment**:
  - Allows highly personalized setups for individual users.
  - Users can install and configure their own applications and settings.
  - Critical for scenarios requiring specific software versions or custom configurations.

- **Multi-Session Environment**:
  - Customization is limited to maintain stability for all users.
  - Administrators manage software installations and updates to avoid conflicts.
  - Restricts the level of personalization achievable by individual users.
  - Focuses on providing a consistent environment for all users.

### Recommendation

While single-session Azure Virtual Desktop for Azure Local offers dedicated resources, performance isolation, and extensive user customization, these benefits come with significantly higher resource demands. **Organizations that prioritize efficient scaling and cost savings should consider Windows 10/11 multi-session as the optimal choice.** By sharing resources across users, reducing infrastructure costs, and delivering a familiar user experience, multi-session deployments provide a compelling solution for businesses seeking to maximize their virtual desktop environments while maintaining high performance. Thus, we recommend that customers pursue the Windows 10/11 multi-session setup for their Azure Virtual Desktop for Azure Local use case.

## Sample Workload Use Case for Azure Virtual Desktop

In this section, we provide a sample workload use-case for Azure Virtual Desktop for Azure Local based on the published [Azure Virtual Desktop user density guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/remote/remote-desktop-services/virtual-machine-recs) that customers may reference when building out a solution.

- **Use Case**
  - **Session Type**: Multi-session
  - **Workload Type**: Medium workload
  - **User Count**: 2,000 users

The multi-session use case is chosen over the single session use case given that most customers utilize this setup. This configuration coupled with Windows 11 Enterprise Multi-session offers an ideal setup for medium workloads, where applications have modest demands in terms of CPU and memory usage. Multi-session capabilities are a significant value proposition especially for Azure Virtual Desktop for Azure Local, enabling efficient resource utilization and cost savings by serving multiple users from a shared pool of resources. Key reasons for selecting this setup include:

1. **General Business Applications**: Multi-session VMs are well-suited for running productivity applications like Microsoft Office, web browsers, and line-of-business applications that do not require high individual user resources.
2. **Cost Effective Solution**: Multi-session setups provide a cost-effective solution for environments with many concurrent users, such as call centers or customer support teams, where many users typically engage in lightweight tasks.

For the recommended use case above, here are the minimum hardware cluster level requirements:

**Multi-Session, Medium Workload, 2,000 Users**
| Physical Cores | Total vCPUs | Total Memory (TB) | Total OS Storage (TB) | Profile Container Storage (TB) |
|----------------|-------------|-------------------|-----------------------|-------------------------------|
| 140            | 280         | 0.7               | 2.0                   | 60.0                          |


Note that this is purely a sample guidance for reference and has not been validated. Additionally, the Node and Cluster Storage (TB) values do not include the Profile Container storage requirements, as the recommendation is that user profiles are stored on a separate file share off the Azure Local cluster for resiliency (e.g., if the cluster goes down, customers have another dormant host pool on a different cluster for high availability, and the user profiles remain secure).

Additionally, these numbers assume 50% concurrency and a 2:1 oversubscription rate (vCPUs to physical cores).
