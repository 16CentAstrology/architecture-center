# Web application cost estimates

All web applications have no up-front cost or termination fees, and you pay only for what you use. Each of them has a cost based on the set of compute resources needed for the web app to run, which is outlined in the App Service plan. Together these costs can help you to determine the total cost for a web app.

Use the [Azure Pricing calculator](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/calculator/) Web products for help creating various cost scenarios.

## App Service plans

An App Service plan defines a set of compute resources for a web app to run. The *pricing tier* of an App Service plan determines what App Service features you get and how much you pay for the plan.
