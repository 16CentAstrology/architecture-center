title: Cost Optimization
summary: When you are designing a cloud solution, focus on generating incremental value early. Apply the principles of Build-Measure-Learn, to accelerate your time to market while avoiding capital-intensive solutions. Use the pay-as-you-go strategy for your architecture, and invest in scaling out, rather than delivering a large investment first version. Consider opportunity costs in your architecture, and the balance between first mover advantage versus "fast follow". Use the cost calculators to estimate the initial cost and operational costs. Finally, establish policies, budgets, and controls that set cost limits for your solution.
