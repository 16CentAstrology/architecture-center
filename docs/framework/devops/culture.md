# DevOps culture and methodoligies

## What is DevOps

The contraction of “Dev” and “Ops” refers to replacing siloed Development and Operations to create multidisciplinary teams that now work together with shared and efficient practices and tools. Essential DevOps practices include agile planning, continuous integration, continuous delivery, and monitoring of applications.

## Team colaboration

It is important to understand how operations and development teams collaborate to address operational issues, and what processes exist to support and structure this collaboration. Moreover, mitigating issues might require the involvement of different teams outside of development or operations, such as networking, and in some cases external parties as well. The processes to support this collaboration should also be understood.

## Operational lifecycles

Reviewing operational incidents where the response and remediation to issues either failed or could have been optimized is vital to improving overall operational effectiveness. Failures provide a valuable learning opportunity and in some cases these learnings can also be shared across the entire organization. Finally, Operational procedures should be updated based on outcomes from frequent testing.

## Operational metadata

Azure Tags provide the ability to associate critical metadata as a name-value pair, such as billing information (e.g. cost center code), environment information (e.g. environment type), with Azure resources, resource groups, and subscriptions. See Tagging Strategies for best practices.
