# Release Engineering: Continuous integration

As code is developed, updated, or even removed, having a friction-free and safe method to integrate these changes into the main code branch is paramount to enabling developers to provide value fast. As a developer, making small code changes, pushing these to a code repository, and getting almost instantaneous feedback on the quality, test coverage, and introduced bugs allows me to work faster, with more confidence, and less risk. Continuous integration is a practice where source control systems and software deployment pipelines are integrated to provide automated build, test, and feedback mechanisms for software development teams. 

Continious integration is about ensuring that software is ready for deployment but does not include the deployment itself. This document covers the basics of continuous integration and offers links and examples for more in-depth content.

## Continious integration

Continious integration is a software development practice under which developers merge software updates into a soruce controll system on a regular cadence. Once merged the following activities may take place:

- Add Bullets for CI

## Continuous integration pipelines

## Packaging
