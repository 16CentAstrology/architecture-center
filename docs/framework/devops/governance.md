# Governing Azure environments

Organizing cloud-based assets in ways that aid operational management and support accounting requirements is a common challenge that faces large cloud adoption efforts.

Well-defined names and tags also help to align cloud usage costs with business teams by using chargeback and showback accounting mechanisms.
