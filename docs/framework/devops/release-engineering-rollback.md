In some cases, a new software deployment can harm or degrade the functionality of a software system. When building your solutions, it is essential to anticipate deployment issues, architect solutions that provide mechanisms for fixing problematic deployments. Rolling back a deployment involves reverting the deployment to a known good state. Rollback can be accomplished in many different ways. Several Azure services support native mechanisms for rolling back to a previous state. Several of these services are detailed in this article.
