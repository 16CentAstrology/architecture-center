# Enforce governance to reduce risks

As part of overall design, prioritize where to invest the available resources; financial, people, and time. Constraints on those resources also affect the security implementation across the organization. Set organizational policies for operations, technologies, and configurations based on internal factors (business requirements, risks, asset evaluation) and external factors (benchmarks, regulatory standards, threat environment). 

## Checklist
**What considerations for compliance and governance did you make?**
***
> [!div class="checklist"]
> - Understand the regulatory requirements and the requirements for operational data that may be used for audits. 
> - Design the workload within the security controls set in the landing zone into which the deployment is deployed.

## In this section

Follow these questions to assess the workload at a deeper level.

|Assessment|Description|
|---|---|
|[**Are there any regulatory requirements for this workload?**](design-regulatory-compliance.md)|Understand all regulatory requirements. Check the Microsoft Trust Center for the latest information, news, and best practices in security, privacy, and compliance.|
|[**Is the organization using a landing zone for this workload?**](design-governance-landing-zone.md)|Consider the security controls placed on the infrastructure into which the workload will get deployed.|
|[Reference model: Segmentation](design-segmentation.md)|Reference model and strategies of how the functions and teams can be segmented.|
|[Management groups and permissions](design-management-groups.md)|Strategies using management groups to manage resources across multiple subscriptions consistently and efficiently.|
|[Regulatory compliance](design-regulatory-compliance.md)|Guidance on standards published by law, authorities, and regulators.|

## Azure security benchmark

The Azure Security Benchmark includes a collection of high-impact security recommendations you can use to help secure the services you use in Azure:

> - [Posture and vulnerability management](/azure/security/benchmarks/security-controls-v2-posture-vulnerability-management) 

## Reference architecture

Here are some reference architectures related to governance:

## Next steps

We recommend that you review the practices and tools have you implemented as part of the development cycle.
