# Monitor Azure resources in Azure Security Center

Identify common security risks significantly reduces overall risk to the organization. Use Azure Security Center to monitor the security posture of machines, networks, storage and data services, and applications to discover potential security issues. Common issues include internet connected VMs, or missing security updates, missing endpoint protection or encryption, deviations from baseline security configurations, missing Web Application Firewall (WAF), and more.

## Virtual machines

If you're running your own Windows and Linux virtual machines, use Azure Security Center. Take advantage of the free services to check for missing OS patches, security misconfiguration, and basic network security. Enabling Azure Defender is highly recommended because you get features that provide adaptive application controls, file integrity monitoring (FIM), and others.

For example, a common risk is the virtual machines don't have vulnerability scanning solutions that check for threats. Azure Security Center reports those machines. You can remediate in Azure Security Center by deploying a scanning solution. You can use the built-in vulnerability scanner for virtual machines. You don't need a license. Instead, you can bring your license for supported partner solutions. 

> [!NOTE]
>
>Vulnerability assessments are also available for container images, and SQL servers.

Attackers constantly scan public cloud IP ranges for open management ports, which can lead to attacks such as common passwords and known unpatched vulnerabilities. JIT (Just In Time) access allows you to lock down the inbound traffic to the virtual machines while providing easy access to connect to machines when needed. Security center identifies which machines should have JIT applied.

With Azure Defender, you also get Microsoft Defender for Endpoint. This provides investigative tools Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) that helps in threat detection and analysis.

Azure Defender for servers also watches the network to and from virtual machines. If you are using network security groups to control access to the virtual machines and the rules are overpermissive, Security Center will flag them. Adaptive network hardening provides recommendations to further harden the NSG rules. 

For a full list of features, see [Feature coverage for machines](/azure/security-center/security-center-services?tabs=features-windows). 

## Containers

Application containers architectures have an extra layer of abstraction and orchestration. That complexity requires specific security measures that protect against common container attacks such as supply chain attacks. 

- Use container registries that are validated for security. Images in public registries may contain malware or unwanted applications that can only get detected when the container is running. Build a process for developers to request and rapidly get security validation of new containers and images. The process should validate against your security standards. This includes applying security updates, scanning for unwanted code such as backdoors and illicit crypto coin miners, scanning for security vulnerabilities, and application of secure development practices.

    A popular process pattern is the quarantine pattern. This pattern allows you to get your images on a dedicated container registry and subject them to security or compliance scrutiny applicable for your organization. After it's validated, they can then be released from quarantine and promoted to being available.

    Azure Security Center identifies unmanaged containers hosted on IaaS Linux VMs, or other Linux machines running Docker containers. 

- Make sure you use images from authorized registries. You can enforce this restriction through Azure Policy. For example, for an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster, have policies that restrict the cluster to only pull images from Azure Container Registry (ACR) that is deployed as part of the architecture.

    > [!TIP]
    > Here are the resources for the preceding example:

    >
    > The design considerations are described in [Baseline architecture for an AKS cluster](../../reference-architectures/containers/aks/secure-baseline-aks.yml).

- Regularly scan containers for known risks in the container registry, before use, and during use. 

- Use security monitoring tools that are container aware to monitor for anomalous behavior and enable investigation of incidents. 

    Azure Defender for container registries protections for AKS clusters, container hosts
(virtual machines running Docker), and ACR registries. When enabled, the images that are pulled or pushed to registries are subject to vulnerability scans.

## Storage

## Network

**How do you monitor and diagnose conditions of the network?** 
***

As an initial step, enable and review all logs (including raw traffic) from your network devices.

- Security group logs â€“ [flow logs](/azure/network-watcher/network-watcher-nsg-flow-logging-portal) and diagnostic logs
- [Azure Network Watcher](/azure/network-watcher/network-watcher-monitoring-overview)

Take advantage of the [packet capture](/azure/network-watcher/network-watcher-alert-triggered-packet-capture) feature to set alerts and gain access to real-time performance information at the packet level. 

Packet capture tracks traffic in and out of virtual machines. It gives you the capability to run proactive captures based on defined network anomalies including information about network intrusions. 

For an example, see [Scenario: Get alerts when VM is sending you more TCP segments than usual](/azure/network-watcher/network-watcher-alert-triggered-packet-capture#scenario).

Then, focus on observability of specific services by reviewing the diagnostic logs. For example, for Azure Application Gateway with integrated WAF, see [Web application firewall logs](/azure/application-gateway/application-gateway-diagnostics). Azure Security Center analyzes diagnostic logs on virtual networks, gateways, network security groups and determines if the controls are secure enough. For example:

- Is your virtual machine exposed to public internet. If so, do you have tight rules on network security groups to protect the machine?
- Are the network security groups (NSG) and rules that control access to the virtual machines overly permissive? 
- Do you have overly-permissive inbound rules for management ports in your Network Security Group? 
- Are the storage accounts receiving traffic over secure connections?

Follow the recommendations provided by Security Center. For more information, see [Networking recommendations](azure/security-center/recommendations-reference#networking-recommendations).

Integrate all logs into a security information and event management (SIEM) service, such as Azure Sentinel. The SIEM solutions support ingestion of large amounts of information and can analyze large datasets quickly. Based on those insights, you can:
- Set alerts or block traffic crossing segmentation boundaries.
- Identify anomalies. 
- Tune the intake to significantly reduce the false positive alerts. 

## Identity
Monitor identity-related risk events using adaptive machine learning algorithms, heuristics quickly before the attacker can gain deeper access into the system.

### Review identity risks

Most security incidents take place after an attacker initially gains access using a stolen identity. Even if the identity has low privileges, the attacker can use it to traverse laterally and gain access to more privileged identities. This way the attacker can control access to the target data or systems.

**Does the organization actively monitor identity-related risk events related to potentially compromised identities?**
***
Monitor identity-related risk events on potentially compromised identities and remediate those risks. 
Review the reported risk events in these ways:

- Azure AD reporting. For information, see [users at risk security report](/azure/active-directory/reports-monitoring/concept-user-at-risk) and the [risky sign-ins security report](/azure/active-directory/reports-monitoring/concept-risky-sign-ins).
- Use the reporting capabilities of [Azure Active Directory Identity Protection](/azure/active-directory/active-directory-identityprotection).
- Use the Identity Protection risk events API to get programmatic access to security detections by using Microsoft Graph. See [riskDetection](/graph/api/resources/riskdetection?view=graph-rest-1.0&preserve-view=true) and [riskyUser](/graph/api/resources/riskyuser?view=graph-rest-1.0&preserve-view=true) APIs.

Azure AD uses adaptive machine learning algorithms, heuristics, and known compromised credentials (username/password pairs) to detect suspicious actions that are related to your user accounts. These username/password pairs come from monitoring public and dark web and by working with security researchers, law enforcement, security teams at Microsoft, and others. 

Remediate risks by manually addressing each reported account or by setting up a [user risk policy](/azure/active-directory/identity-protection/howto-user-risk-policy) to require a password change for high risk events. 

### Connected tenants
Make sure the security team is aware of all enrollments and associated subscriptions connected to your existing environment (through ExpressRoute or Site-Site VPN. Monitor them as part of the overall enterprise.

Assess if organizational policies and applicable regulatory requirements are followed for the connected tenants. This applies to all Azure environments that connect to your production environment network.

For information about permissions for this access, see [Assign privileges for managing the environment section]/azure/architecture/framework/security/governance?branch=master#assign-privileges-for-managing-the-environment).

**Is personal information detected and removed/obfuscated automatically?**
***

Be cautious when logging sensitive application information. Don't store  personal information such as contact information, payment information, and so on, in any application logs. Apply protective measures, such as obfuscation. Machine learning tools can help with this measure. For more information, see [PII Detection cognitive skill](/azure/search/cognitive-search-skill-pii-detection).
