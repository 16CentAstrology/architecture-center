# Monitor Azure resources in Azure Security Center

Identify common security risks significantly reduces overall risk to the organization. Use Azure Security Center to monitor the security posture of machines, networks, storage and data services, and applications to discover potential security issues. Common issues include internet connected VMs, or missing security updates, missing endpoint protection or encryption, deviations from baseline security configurations, missing Web Application Firewall (WAF), and more.

## Review advanced controls
Review notification from advanced security features. Here are some examples:
