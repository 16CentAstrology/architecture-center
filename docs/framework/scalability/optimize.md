- **Improvement options** - The first step for determining options for improvement is to ensure that you are capturing telemetry throughout your application. [Application Insights](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/app/app-insights-overview) provides some great telemetry out of the box, and you can customize what is captured for even greater visibility. Next, you may want to compare your code to proven architectures in the [Cloud Design Patterns](../../patterns/index-patterns). By referencing the design patterns, you can avoid common mistakes by developers who are deploying applications into the cloud. Finally, you may consider other Azure services that may be more appropriate for your objectives. While Azure has many services that seem to overlap in capabilities, often there are specific use-cases for which the services are designed.

- **Plan on Resolution planning** - Resolving performance issues requires time and patience&mdash;not just in discovery and investigation, but also in resolution. Code enhancements may be accomplished by deploying a new build, but enhancements to infrastructure may involve many teams. Some services may require updated configurations while others may need to be deprecated in favor of more-appropriate solutions. Regardless, it is critical that you understand the scope of your planned resolution so that all necessary stakeholders are informed.
