# Well-Architected Recommendation Process Guidance

## Overview

The purpose of this document is to provide a guide for incorporating the recommendations generated by the [Microsoft Azure Well-Architected Review](/assessments/?mode=pre-assessment) and [Azure Advisor](/azure/advisor) into a new or established operational process for continuous workload improvement.

## Assess Workload

This first step in the **Well-Architect Recommendation Process** is to conduct an assessment of your workload.  The [Microsoft Azure Well-Architected Review](/assessments/?mode=pre-assessment) tool generates a set of recommendations via a guided assessment based on the [Microsoft Well-Architected Framework](/azure/architecture/framework/). This tool also has the ability to pull in [Azure Advisor](/azure/advisor) recommendations based on an Azure Subscription or Resource Group. At the end of the assessment, there is an option to export these recommendations into a CSV file that can then be used to incorporate them into the operational process for the workload.

> [!NOTE]
> When using the [Microsoft Azure Well-Architected Review](/assessments/?mode=pre-assessment) tool, it is important to 'Sign In' and select the Azure Subscription or Resource Group that contains your workload.  This will ensure that only the relevant [Azure Advisor](/azure/advisor) recommendations are included when exporting the CSV.

## Integrate Recommendations

The goal of this stage is to establish a backlog of work items either thru a manual or an automated process that is based on the recommendations generated by the assessment.  The process and tooling for managing the backlog for your workload should be well defined based on your [cloud operating model](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/operating-model/).

> [!NOTE]
>The [Microsoft Cloud Adoption Framework for Azure](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/overview) is proven guidance that's designed to help you create and implement the business and technology strategies necessary for your organization to succeed in the cloud.  This guidance can help you define the [cloud operating model](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/operating-model/) that governs the operational process for your workload.

If you are using a [DevOps](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ready/enterprise-scale/platform-automation-and-devops#planning-for-a-devops-approach) approach for your operational process, Microsoft has provided tools that will import the recommendations exported CSV into an existing [Azure DevOps](/azure/devops) or GitHub project: [DevOps Tooling for Well-Architected Recommendation Process](/azure/architecture/framework/warp/tools/devops/README.md).

## Triage Backlog

Now that the recommendations have been added to the backlog, the workload owners and key stakeholders should prioritize then triage the recommendations in a weekly standup meeting with the workload team. Then, they assign to a specific owner, postpone, or dismiss.  When assigned to a specific owner, the recommendation should be tracked until resolved and weekly/monthly reminders are sent to the assignee.

When going thru this process, it is recommended to align responsibilities across teams by developing a cross-team matrix that identifies [_responsible, accountable, consulted, and informed (RACI)_](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/organize/raci-alignment) parties.  Some of the key benefits of this exercise are:

- Assist teams in charting roles and responsibilities in a consistent manner
- Assist teams with development of implementation tool kits
- Clarify individual/departmental roles and responsibilities
- Identify accountabilities
- Eliminate misunderstandings, encourage teamwork
- Reduce duplication of effort
- Establish “consults” and “informs” resulting in better communication

## Implement Work Items

This stage of the process is focused on working thru the backlog of recommendations.  How you organize this work will depend on your [cloud operating model](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/operating-model).  For example, an [Agile-based](/azure/devops/boards/get-started/plan-track-work?view=azure-devops&tabs=agile-process) process would have an emphasis on sprint planning paired with frequent stand ups so that progress can be tracked and reported on.

## Monitor Progress

This stage of the process is to monitor improvements to a workload relative to the [Microsoft Well-Architected Framework](/azure/architecture/framework) thru each iterative.  It is important to establish a baseline based on the [Microsoft Azure Well-Architected Review](/assessments/?mode=pre-assessment) and [Azure Advisor](/azure/advisor) so that improvements are trackable back to key recommendations and/or metrics.

The [Azure Advisor Score](/azure/advisor/azure-advisor-score) is a key metric that is available for tracking and socializing improvements during this continuous process of improvement.
