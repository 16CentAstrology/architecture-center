# Cloud design patterns

Architects design workloads by integrating platform services, functionality, and code to meet both functional and nonfunctional requirements. Designing effective workloads requires you to understand these requirements and select topologies and methodologies that address the challenges posed by the workload's constraints. Cloud design patterns provide solutions to many common challenges.

System design heavily relies on established design patterns. Infrastructure, code, and distributed systems are developed by using a combination of these patterns. These patterns are crucial for building reliable, more secure, cost-optimized, operationally efficient, and high-performing applications in the cloud.

The following cloud design patterns are technology-agnostic, which makes them suitable for any distributed system. You can apply these patterns across Azure, other cloud platforms, on-premises setups, and hybrid environments.

## How cloud design patterns enhance the design process

Cloud workloads are vulnerable to the [fallacies of distributed computing](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallacies_of_distributed_computing), which are common but incorrect assumptions about how distributed systems operate. Examples of these fallacies include:

- The network is reliable.
- Latency is zero.
- Bandwidth is infinite.
- The network is secure.
- Topology doesn't change.
- There's one administrator.
- Component versioning is simple.
- Observability implementation can be delayed.

These misconceptions can result in flawed workload designs. Design patterns don't eliminate these misconceptions but help raise awareness, provide compensation strategies, and provide mitigations. Each cloud design pattern has trade-offs. Focus on why you should choose a specific pattern instead of how to implement it.

A well-architected workload considers how these industry-standard design patterns should be used as the core building blocks for workload design. Each design pattern in the Azure Well-Architected Framework represents one or more of its pillars. However, adopting specific patterns might introduce trade-offs with the goals of other pillars.

## Pattern catalog

Each pattern in this catalog describes the problem that it addresses, considerations for applying the pattern, and an example based on Microsoft Azure. Some patterns include code samples or snippets that show how to implement the pattern on Azure.
