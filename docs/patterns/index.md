# Cloud Design Patterns

Architects design workloads by combining platform services, functionality, and code to fulfill functional and nonfunctional requirements in workloads. Designing workloads requires understanding of those workload requirements and then choosing topologies and approaches the solve for the challenges presented by the constraints of the workload. Cloud design patterns that address many common challenges.

Systems design is heavily steeped in design patterns. Infrastructure, code, and distributed systems are all designed around a combination of design patterns. These design patterns are useful for building reliable, secure, cost optimized, operationally sound, and performant applications in the cloud.

These design patterns aren't specific to any technology and are relevant to any distributed system, whether hosted on Azure, other cloud platforms, and some can even extend to on-premises or hybrid workloads.

## Cloud design patterns help the design process

Cloud workloads are prone to the [fallacies of distributed computing](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallacies_of_distributed_computing). Some examples of cloud design fallacies are:

- The network is reliable
- Latency is zero
- Bandwidth is infinite
- The network is secure
- Topology doesn't change
- There's one administrator
- Component versioning is simple
- Observability implementation can be delayed

Design patterns don't eliminate notions such as these but can help bring awareness, compensations, and mitigations of them. Each cloud pattern has its own trade-offs. You need to pay attention more to why you're choosing a certain pattern than to how to implement it.

A well-architected workload considers how these industry-wide design patterns should be used as the core building blocks for workload design. Every Azure Well-Architected pillar is represented in these design patterns, often with the design pattern introducing tradeoffs with the goals of other pillars.

## Catalog of patterns

Each pattern in this catalog describes the problem that the pattern addresses, considerations for applying the pattern, and an example based on Microsoft Azure. Some patterns include code samples or snippets that show how to implement the pattern on Azure.
