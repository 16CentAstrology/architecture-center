# Reliable web app pattern

The reliable web app pattern details essential implementation guidance for migrating on-premises .NET and Java web apps to the cloud. It builds on the overarching principles of the enterprise app patterns and focuses on the minimal changes you need to make to ensure your web app is successful in the cloud. The implementation guidance shows you how to apply reliability design patterns to your code. It also details the essential changes you need to make to ensure your web app is secure, cost-optimized, high-performing, and operationally excellent.

**Why the reliable web app pattern?** It's not always clear what you need to do after you migrate a web to the cloud. You might not be aware of the implementation changes you could and should make to maximize your success. The reliable web app pattern solves this problem. The implementation guidance tells you what you should to migrate web apps to the cloud successfully and how to do it with code examples.

There are sample web application (reference implementations) that you can deploy. These reference implementations apply the reliable web app pattern. For more information, see the [.NET reference implementation](https://aka.ms/eap/rwa/dotnet) and the [Java reference implementation](https://github.com/Azure/reliable-web-app-pattern-java#reliable-web-app-pattern-for-java)

**How to implement the reliable web app pattern.** The following reliable web app articles provide the implementation guidance you need to migrate .NET and Java web apps to the cloud.
