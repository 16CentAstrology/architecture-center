# Reliable web app pattern

The reliable web app pattern provides implementation guidance for web applications that you have recently migrated to the cloud. The pattern focuses on the minimal code and architecture changes needed to be successful in the cloud. It builds on the underlying principles of the enterprise app patterns. These principles target low-cost, high-value work to meet business objectives while adhering to the tenets of the Well-Architected Framework.

## Why use the reliable web app pattern?

The reliable web app pattern outlines crucial steps to ensure the effectiveness of your web app in the cloud. While reinforcing general best practices, it also emphasizes cloud-specific principles that might be unfamiliar to many developers. This pattern provides comprehensive implementation guidance, complete with code examples and a reference implementation (sample web app), allowing for rapid adoption and application of the guidance.

## How to use the reliable web app pattern

For each technology stack, there are two articles and a reference implementation (sample web app) available for deployment. Plan the Implementation assists you in aligning your architecture and business requirements. Apply the Pattern demonstrates how to execute the necessary code and architectural modifications. The Reference Implementation offers example code for you to utilize and learn from. Employ these three components as needed to ensure your web app's success in the cloud.
