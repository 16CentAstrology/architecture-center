The SAP on Azure architecture center provides architectural guidance for SAP workloads running on Azure. It captures specific use cases for SAP workloads and gives various levels of detail on implementation, configuration, and deployment instruction. This guidance builds on the principles of the Cloud Adoption Framework (CAF) and Microsoft Well-Architected Framework (WAF).  Within those frameworks, we’ve created custom guidance for SAP on Azure. These provide standard best practices that will help you with your SAP cloud adoption and workload.

**SAP cloud adoption**<br>
Our SAP cloud adoption guidance outlines the process of integrating an SAP platform into your cloud adoption efforts. For more information, see [SAP adoption scenario]( /azure/cloud-adoption-framework/scenarios/sap/).

**SAP workload best practices** <br>
Our workload best practices provide architecture design recommendations to follow throughout the lifecycle of an SAP workload. For more information, see [SAP workload best practices]( /azure/architecture/framework/sap/overview).

**Architecture center** <br>
The articles in the SAP on Azure architecture center contain guides, architectures, and solution ideas. These are three different types of articles with a different intent that’s worth reviewing:

*Guides*<br>
The guides provide check lists, configurations, and design guidance. They offer you instructions to implement best practices for SAP solutions.

*Architectures*<br>
The architectures give detailed instructions on how to design SAP platforms, workloads, and applications in Azure. Some of the architectures provide infrastructure-as-code templates that let you deploy the solution to your subscription.

*Solution ideas*<br>
Solution ideas are conceptual. Subject matter experts develop these ideas to inspire others to test and develop real-world SAP solutions from these concepts.
