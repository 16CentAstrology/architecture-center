The SAP on Azure architecture center provides architectural guidance for SAP workloads running on Azure. The architectural content  provides implementation, configuration, and deployment instructions for SAP platforms, workloads, and applications. The guidance applies the principles of the Cloud Adoption Framework (CAF) and the Well-Architected Framework (WAF) to specific SAP use cases. It assumes a familiarity with these principles and our guidance specific to SAP. The pages gives a brief overview of the SAP frameworks and SAP architecture guidance.

## SAP frameworks

We have two SAP frameworks: SAP cloud adoption and SAP workload best practices. These frameworks cover the entire cloud adoption journey from migration to workload operations.

**SAP cloud adoption** - The SAP cloud adoption guidance outlines the process of integrating an SAP platform into your cloud adoption efforts.

**SAP workload** - Our workload best practices provide architecture design recommendations to follow throughout the lifecycle of an SAP workload.

## SAP architecture guidance

You'll find different types of content in the SAP on Azure architecture center. We have guides, architectures, and solution ideas, each with a different purpose and application.

**Guides** - The guides provide check lists, configurations, and design guidance. They offer instructions to implement best practices for SAP solutions.

**Architectures** - Architectures give detailed instructions on how to design SAP platforms, workloads, and applications in Azure. Some have code that lets you deploy the solution.

**Solution ideas** - Solution ideas are conceptual. They're meant to inspire new ideas and novel approaches to architecture.
