The SAP on Azure architecture center provides architectural guidance for SAP workloads running on Azure. The architectural content  provides implementation, configuration, and deployment instructions for SAP platforms, workloads, and applications. The guidance applies the principles of the Cloud Adoption Framework (CAF) and the Well-Architected Framework (WAF) to specific SAP use cases. It assumes a familiarity with these principles and our guidance specific to SAP. For more information, see:

- [SAP adoption scenario]( /azure/cloud-adoption-framework/scenarios/sap/)
- [SAP workload best practices]( /azure/architecture/framework/sap/overview)

You'll find different types of content in the SAP on Azure architecture center. We have guides, architectures, and solution ideas, each with a different purpose and application.

**Guides** - The guides provide check lists, configurations, and design guidance. They offer instructions to implement best practices for SAP solutions. For more information, see [Guides](../../guide/sap/sap-internet-inbound-outbound.yml).

**Architectures** - Architectures give detailed instructions on how to design SAP platforms, workloads, and applications in Azure. Some have code that lets you deploy the solution. For more information, see [Architectures](run-sap-hana-for-linux-virtual-machines.yml).

**Solution ideas** - Solution ideas are conceptual. They're meant to inspire new ideas and novel approaches to architecture. For more information, see [Solution ideas](../../solution-ideas/articles/sap-netweaver-on-sql-server.yml)
