## Recommendations

The following recommendations apply for most scenarios. Follow these recommendations unless you have a specific requirement that overrides them.

_Recommendations for deploying or configuring components of this architecture._

_This section is followed by considerations that are loosely based on the [Well Architected Framework pillars](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/framework/). Not all considerations will apply to every architecture, as there are trade-offs._

## Security considerations

_Identify and address security concerns and tradeoffs relevant to the architecture in this scenario._

## Reliability considerations

_Identify and address reliability concerns and tradeoffs relevant to the architecture in this scenario._

## Scalability considerations

_Identify and address scalability concerns and tradeoffs relevant to the architecture in this scenario._

## Availability considerations

_Identify and address availability concerns and tradeoffs relevant to the architecture in this scenario._

## Operational considerations

_Identify and address operational and DevOps concerns and tradeoffs relevant to the architecture in this scenario._

## Cost considerations

## Deploy the solution

_This section should be a brief overview of the deployment process. The actual deployment steps must be documented in a readme.md alongwith the reference implementation on the PnP samples repository. If that is not possible, include a separate article to walk through the deployment steps and/or the source code. This section should only link to the readme or the deployment walk-through, and not go into the actual steps. Remember that this is not a tutorial._

To deploy the reference implementation for this architecture, see the [GitHub readme](https://www.github.com/path-to-repo).

## Related resources

_Include links to relevant articles that will help deeper understanding of concepts touched in this article._

## Next steps

_Include articles from AAC or elsewhere from docs.microsoft.com that can be useful in developing a complete scenario for the customers._
