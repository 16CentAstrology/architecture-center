# Industry specific Azure IoT reference architectures

This article provides an overview of industry-specific internet-of-things (IoT) reference architectures and example solutions.

The following Azure IoT solutions and example scenarios address unique business challenges for specific industries. For overall IoT patterns and guides that apply across industry verticals, see, [IoT architectures](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/browse/?azure_categories=iot)

## Automotive and transportation

- [Real-time asset tracking for vehicles](../../solution-ideas/articles/real-time-asset-tracking-mgmt-iot-central.yml). Azure IoT Central and other Azure services track and manage vehicles and other assets in real time.

- [Automated guided vehicles fleet control](../../example-scenario/iot/automated-guided-vehicles-fleet-control.yml). Automated guided vehicles (AGVs) are an important part of just-in-time manufacturing and automated shop-floor logistics. In this example, AGVs deliver parts to automotive assembly lines.

## Energy and environment

- [Environmental monitoring and supply chain optimization with IoT](../../solution-ideas/articles/environment-monitoring-and-supply-chain-optimization.yml). Environmental monitoring is crucial for global supply chain management. A warehouse management scenario monitors environmental conditions and processes the data with machine learning (ML) to generate predictions.

- [Project 15 Open Platform IoT sustainability](../../solution-ideas/articles/project-15-iot-sustainability.yml). Open Platform open-source software connects to the cloud and securely manages devices for scientific and conservation projects. This architecture is a reference for building open-source, end-to-end IoT solutions.

## Manufacturing

- [Condition monitoring for industrial IoT](../../solution-ideas/articles/condition-monitoring.yml). Condition monitoring helps manufacturers discover anomalies before they become critical. In this solution, IoT devices connect to the cloud through OPC UA and Azure industrial IoT components.

- [End-to-end computer vision at the edge for manufacturing](../../reference-architectures/ai/end-to-end-smart-factory.yml). Industries use computer vision and ML for safety and quality assurance applications. This example shows an end-to-end approach to IoT computer vision that improves processes over time.
