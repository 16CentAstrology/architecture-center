This reference architecture describes the considerations for an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster designed to run a sensitive workload. The guidance is tied to the regulatory requirements of the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS). 

## Shared responsibility model

**Microsoft Trust Center** provides specific principles for compliance-related cloud deployments. The security assurances&mdash;provided by Azure as the cloud platform and AKS as the host container&mdash;are regularly audited and attested by third-party auditors for PCI DSS compliance.

- **Shared responsibility with Azure**

	The Microsoft Compliance team ensures all documentation of Microsoft Azure regulatory compliance is publicly available to our customers. Microsoft Azureâ€™s PCI DSS Attestation of Compliance can be downloaded under the PCI DSS section at [audit reports](https://servicetrust.microsoft.com). The responsibility matrix outlines who, between Azure and the customer, is responsible for each of the PCI requirements. For more information, see [Managing compliance in the cloud](https://www.microsoft.com/trust-center/compliance/compliance-overview).

- **Shared responsibility with AKS**

	Kubernetes is an open-source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. AKS makes it simple to deploy a managed Kubernetes cluster on Azure. The AKS fundamental infrastructure supports large-scale applications in the cloud, and is a natural choice for running enterprise-scale applications in the cloud, including PCI workloads. Applications deployed in AKS clusters have certain complexities when deploying PCI-classified workloads.

As a workload owner, you're ultimately responsible for your own PCI DSS compliance. Have a clear understanding of your responsibilities by reading the PCI requirements to understand the intent, studying the matrix for Azure, and completing this series to understand the AKS nuances. This process will make your implementation ready for a successful assessment.

## Recommended learning approach
The [PCI audit report](https://servicetrust.microsoft.com) is great place to start, to understand the shared responsibility between Azure and you. This series aims to fill the gaps between the current PCI DSS responsibility matrix and what a PCI deployment would require on AKS. 

This series is split into several articles. Each article outlines the high-level PCI requirement, and provides guidance about how to address the AKS-specific requirement.

|Area of responsibility|Description|
|---|---|
|[Network segmentation](aks-pci-network.yml)|TBD |
|[Data protection](aks-pci-data.yml)|TBD|
|[Vulnerability management](aks-pci-malware.yml)|TBD|
|[Access controls](aks-pci-identity.yml)|TBD|
|[Monitoring operations](aks-pci-monitor.yml)|TBD|
|[Policy management](aks-pci-policy.yml)|TBD|

This series assumes:
- You're familiar with Kubernetes concepts and workings of an [AKS cluster](/azure/aks).
- You've read the [AKS baseline reference architecture](/azure/architecture/reference-architectures/containers/aks/secure-baseline-aks).
- You've deployed the [AKS baseline reference implementation](https://github.com/mspnp/aks-secure-baseline).
- You're well versed with the official [PCI DSS specification](https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/documents/PCI_DSS_v3-2-1.pdf). 
- You've read the [Azure security baseline for Azure Kubernetes Service](/security/benchmark/azure/baselines/aks-security-baseline).
