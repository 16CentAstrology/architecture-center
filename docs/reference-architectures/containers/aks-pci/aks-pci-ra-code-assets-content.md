This article describes a reference architecture for an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster that runs a workload in compliance with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS). This architecture is focused on the infrastructure and _not_ the PCI-DSS workload.

> This article is part of a series. Read the [introduction](aks-pci-intro.yml) here.

The recommendations and examples are extracted from this accompanying reference implementation:

![GitHub logo](../../../_images/github.png) [GitHub: Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) Baseline Cluster for Regulated Workloads](https://github.com/mspnp/aks-baseline-regulated) demonstrates the regulated infrastructure. This implementation provides a microservices application. It's included to help you experience the infrastructure and illustrate the network and security controls. The application does _not_ represent or implement an actual PCI DSS workload.


![Placeholder](images/regulated-architecture.svg)

That architecture is based on a hub and spoke topology; with one hub and two spokes. The hub virtual network contains the firewall to control egress traffic, gateway traffic from on-premises networks, and a third network for maintenance. There are two spoke virtual networks. One spoke contains the AKS cluster that provides the card-holder environment (CDE), and hosts the PCI DSS workload. The other spoke builds virtual machine images for your workloads.

## Components

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> The architecture and the implementation builds on the [AKS baseline architecture](/azure/architecture/reference-architectures/containers/aks/secure-baseline-aks). Familiarize yourself with the baseline. In this section, we'll highlight the differences between the two architectures.

**Azure Bastion**

The baseline architecture provided a subnet for Bastion but didn't provision the resource. This architecture adds Bastion in the subnet. It provides secure access to a jump box.

**Azure Virtual Machines (VM)**

The spoke network has an additional compute for a jump box. This machine is intended to run management tools on the AKS cluster, such as kubectl.

**Azure Image Builder**

Provisioned in a separate virtual network. Creates VM images with base security and configuration. In this architecture, it's customized to build secure node images with Ubuntu 18.04-LTS platform (MSFT-provided) image with management tools such as Azure CLI, kubectl and kubelogin, flux CLI.

**Nginx** 

Kubernetes ingress controller inside the cluster. In the baseline architecture, Traefik was used. The service was replaced to illustrate that the service can be changed based on your choice.

## Networking configuration

The hub and spokes are all deployed in separate virtual networks, each in their private address space. Each subnet is isolated with no traffic allowed by default between any two virtual networks. 




Use a combination of various Azure services and feature and native Kubernetes constructs to provide the required level of control. Here are some options used in this architecture.   

### Strict Network Security Groups (NSGs)

Place NSGs on subnets that interact with the cluster. in st around the cluster node pool subnets specifically block any SSH access attempts only allow traffic from the vnet into them. As your workloads, system security agents, etc are deployed, consider adding even more NSG rules that help define the type of traffic that should and should not be traversing those subnet boundaries. Because each nodepool lives in its own subnet, you can apply more specific rules based on known/expected traffic patterns of your workload.

### Azure Key Vault network restrictions

In this reference implementation, Azure Application Gateway (AAG) is sourcing its public-facing certificate from Azure Key Vault. This is great as it help support easier certificate rotation and certificate control. However, currently Azure Application Gateway does not support this on Azure Key Vault instances that are exclusively network restricted via Private Link. This reference implementation deploys Azure Key Vault in a hybrid model, supporting private link and public access specifically to allow AAG integration. Once [Azure Application Gateway supports private link access to Key Vault](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/application-gateway/key-vault-certs#how-integration-works), we'll update this reference implementation. If this topology will not be suitable for your deployment, change the certificate management process in AAG to abandon the use of Key Vault for the public-facing TLS certificate and [handle the management of that certificate directly within AAG](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/application-gateway/tutorial-ssl-cli). Doing so will allow your Key Vault instance to be fully isolated.

### Expanded NetworkPolicies

Not all user-provided namespaces in this reference implementation employ a zero-trust network. For example `cluster-baseline-settings` does not. We provide an example of zero-trust networks in `a0005-i` and `a0005-o` as your reference implementation of the concept. All namespaces (other than `kube-system`, `gatekeeper-system`, and other AKS-provided namespaces) should have a maximally restrictive NetworkPolicy applied. What those policies will be will be based on the pods running in those namespaces. Ensure your accounting for readiness, liveliness, and startup probes and also accounting for metrics gathering by `oms-agent`.  Consider standardizing on ports across your workloads so that you can provide a consistent NetworkPolicy and even Azure Policy for allowed container ports.

### Enable DDoS Protection

While not typically a feature of any specific regulated workloads, generally speaking [Azure DDoS Protection Standard](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/ddos-protection/manage-ddos-protection) should be enabled for any virtual networks with a subnet that contains an Application Gateway with a public IP. This protects your workload from becoming overwhelmed with fraudulent requests which at best could cause a service disruption or at worst be a cover (distraction, log spam, etc) for another concurrent attack. Azure DDoS comes at a significant cost, and is typically amortized across many workloads that span many IP addresses -- work with your networking team to coordinate coverage for your workload.

### Workload isolation
The main theme of the PCI standard is to isolate the PCI workload from other workloads in terms of operations and connectivity. In this series we differentiate between those concepts as:

- In-scope&mdash;The PCI workload, the environment in which it resides, and operations.

- Out-of-scope&mdash;Other workloads that may share services but are isolated from the in-scope components.

The key strategy is to provide the required level of segmentation. One way is to deploy in-scope and out-of-scope components in separate clusters. The down side is increased costs for the added infrastructure and the maintenance overhead. Another approach is to colocate all components in a shared cluster. Use segmentation strategies to maintain the separation. 

In the reference implementation, the second approach is demonstrated with a microservices application deployed to a single cluster. The application has  two sets of services; one set has in-scope pods and the other is out-of-scope. Both sets are spread across two user node pools. With the use of Kubernetes taints, in-scope and out-of-scope pods are deployed to separate nodes and they never share a node VM.
