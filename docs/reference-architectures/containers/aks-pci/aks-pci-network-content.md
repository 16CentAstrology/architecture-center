![GitHub logo](../../../_images/github.png) [GitHub: Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) Baseline Cluster for Regulated Workloads](https://github.com/mspnp/aks-baseline-regulated) demonstrates the regulated infrastructure. This implementation provides a microservices application. It's included to help you experience the infrastructure and illustrate the network and security controls. The application does not represent or implement an actual PCI DSS workload.
