This reference architecture shows the holistic view of a web-app workload on Azure Red Hat OpenShift in a zone-redundant configuration. [Zone-redundant services][az-ha-services] replicate your services and data across availability zones to protect them from single points of failure and provide high availability.

Before you build a production environment with Azure Red Hat OpenShift, read [Azure Red Hat OpenShift landing zone accelerator](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/scenarios/app-platform/azure-red-hat-openshift/landing-zone-accelerator).

### Workflow

A user sends a request to Azure. The request is received by Azure Front Door and routed to a web application that's hosted on Azure Red Hat OpenShift. The web application runs the client request by using the Azure services, Azure Key Vault, Azure Cosmos DB, and Azure Container Registry. The web application sends a response back to the client.

### Components

* [Azure Active Directory (Azure AD)][aad] or [Azure AD B2C][aad-b2c] authenticates users. The browser performs DNS lookups to resolve addresses to Azure Front Door.
* [Azure Front Door][afd] is the public interface for all internet requests. It acts as a global HTTP reverse proxy and cache for back-end (origin) services. Front Door provides features that enhance the security and performance of your application, like protection from layer 4 distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks.
* [Azure Red Hat OpenShift][aro] is the Kubernetes-based container orchestrator that hosts the API applications and services, and provides a front-end for back-end services.
* [Azure Container Registry][acr] supports Docker and Open Container Initiative (OCI) compliant container images.
* Azure Red Hat OpenShift uses [Virtual Network (VNet) Integration][vnet-integration] to connect to backend services over a private VNet.
* [Azure Cosmos DB][cosmos-db] provides NoSQL document databases for front-end services.
* [Private endpoints][peps] enable connections to back-end Azure services from private VNets and enable you to disable the public endpoints on these services.
* [Azure private DNS][private-dns] configures and updates the DNS records that are required by private endpoint services.
* [Azure Key Vault][akv] securely stores secrets and certificates that are accessed by Azure services.
* [Azure Monitor][azmon] and [Application Insights][insights] collect service logs and application performance metrics for observability.

### Alternatives

* You can use Azure AD or Azure AD B2C as an identity provider (IdP) in this scenario. Azure AD is for internal applications and business-to-business (B2B) scenarios. Azure AD B2C is for business-to-consumer (B2C) scenarios.
* Azure-managed DNS is recommended, but you can alternately use your own DNS provider.
* You can use [Azure Application Gateway][appgw] instead of Azure Front Door if most of your users are located close to the Azure region that hosts your workload and if you don't need content caching. Use [Azure DDoS Protection][ddosp] to protect internet-facing Application Gateway services.
* Deploy a premium [Azure API Management][apim] instance with zone-redundancy as an alternative for hosting frontend APIs, backend APIs, or both. For more information about API Management zone-redundancy, see [Migrate Azure API Management to availability zone support][apim-zr].
* You can use OpenShift Container Platform or Origin Community Distribution of Kubernetes (OKD) on [Azure Virtual Machines][az-vm] instead of Azure Red Hat OpenShift. OpenShift Container Platform or OKD are infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) alternatives to a fully platform managed (PaaS) service, like Azure Red Hat OpenShift. For more information, see [OpenShift in Azure][openshift-in-azure].

## Scenario details

This architecture builds on [availability zones infrastructure][azs] that's found in many regions today. For a list of regions that support Azure availability zones, see [Azure regions with availability zones][az-regions].

Availability zones spread a solution across multiple independent zones within a region, which keeps an application functioning when one zone fails. Most mainstream Azure services and many specialized Azure services provide support for availability zones. All Azure services in this architecture are zone-redundant, which simplifies the deployment and management. For a list of Azure services that support availability zones, see [Azure Services that support availability zones][az-services].

To maintain their [service-level agreements (SLAs)][sla], zone-redundant Azure Red Hat OpenShift manages and mitigates failures, including zone failures. Zone redundancy provides a recovery time of zero for zone failure. If a single zone in a region is unavailable, you don't lose any data, and your workload continues to run. Zone redundancy is configured at deployment time and is managed by services, so you don't need to manage zone pinning or zonal deployments.

When hosting platforms are at scale, it's often difficult to keep them highly available. High availability has historically required complex and expensive multi-region deployments with data consistency and high performance tradeoffs.

[Availability zones][azs] resolve many of these issues. Availability zones are separate physical locations in each Azure region. Availability zones spread a solution across multiple independent zones in a region, which allows an application to continue functioning when one zone fails.

This architecture describes how to compose zone-redundant services into a solution that provides high availability and is resilient to zonal failures.

Azure Front Door, Azure AD, and Azure DNS are globally available services that are resilient to zone and region-wide outages. All other services are zone-redundant.

### Potential use cases

Azure Red Hat OpenShift is a container orchestration service that uses Kubernetes. It's suitable for many use cases such as:

* Banking
* Stock trading
* E-commerce
* Social media
* Web applications
* Mobile applications
* Batch processing applications
* Media streaming
* Machine learning workloads

## Recommendations

The following recommendations apply to most scenarios.

### Front Door

Azure Front Door is a global service that provides resilience to zone and region failures.

* Use [Azure managed certificates][afd-certs] on all frontends to prevent certificate mis-configuration and expiration issues.
* Enable [Caching][afd-cache] on routes where appropriate to improve availability. Front Door's cache distributes your content to the Azure PoP (point of presence) edge nodes. In addition to improving your performance, caching reduces the load on your origin servers.
* Deploy Azure Front Door Premium and configure a [WAF policy][afd-waf] with a Microsoft-managed ruleset. Apply the policy to all custom domains. Use Prevention mode to mitigate web attacks that might cause an origin service to become unavailable.

### Red Hat OpenShift

An [Azure Red Hat OpenShift][aro] cluster is automatically deployed across three availability zones in Azure regions that support them. A cluster consists of three control-plane nodes and three or more worker nodes, each of which is spread across zones to improve redundancy.

* Ensure that the Azure region where Azure Red Hat OpenShift is to be deployed supports availability zones. For more information, see [Azure regions with availability zone support][az-regions].
* Ensure that all services that an Azure Red Had OpenShift cluster depends on support and are configured for zone redundancy. For more information, see [Azure services with availability zone support][az-ha-services].
* Remove state from containers and make use of Azure storage or database services instead.
* Set up multiple replicas in deployments, with appropriate disruption budget configuration, to continuously provide application service over disruptions like hardware failures in zones.
* Secure access to Azure Red Hat OpenShift so that only Front Door traffic is allowed. This ensures that requests are not able to bypass the Azure Front Door WAF (Web Application Firewall). For more information about restricting access to a specific Azure Front Door instance, see [Secure access to Azure Red Hat OpenShift with Azure Front Door][aro-afd].

### Container Registry

[Azure Container Registry][acr] supports zone redundancy making Azure Continer registry highly available and resilient to zone failure. Azure Container Registry also supports [geo-replication][acr-georeplica], which replicates the service across multiple regions. 

* Zone redundancy is a feature of the Premium container registry service tier. For information about registry service tiers and limits, see [Azure Container Registry service tiers][acr-tier].
* Ensure that [a region which a container registry is deployed in supports availability zones][az-regions].
* Once a container registry is deployed, its zone redundancy option cannot be changed. After deployment, zone redundancy option in the container registry cannot be disabled or enabled.
* ACR Tasks doesn't support availability zones yet.

For more information, see [Enable zone redundancy in Azure Container Registry for resiliency and high availability][acr-zoneredundancy] and [Use Azure Container Registry with Azure Red Hat OpenShift (ARO)][aro-acr].

### Cosmos DB

Enable [zone-redundancy in Azure Cosmos DB][cosmos-ha] when selecting a region to associate with your Azure Cosmos account.

* Enable zone-redundancy when adding the local read/write region to the Azure Cosmos account.
* [Enable continuous backups][cosmos-backup].
* [Configure private link for the Cosmos DB account][cosmos-pep]. Enabling the private endpoint will disable the public endpoint.
* Integrate the Private endpoint with an Azure Private DNS zone.

### Key Vault

Key Vault is automatically zone-redundant in any region where Availability zones are available. The Key Vault used in this architecture is deployed with a private endpoint enabled and public endpoint disabled. For more information about Private endpoints for Azure Key Vault, see [Integrate Key Vault with Azure Private Link][akv-pep].

### Azure DNS Private Zones

Integrate Private Endpoints with Azure DNS Private Zones to simplify DNS management. For more information, see [Azure Private Endpoint DNS configuration][pep-dns].

## Considerations

These considerations implement the pillars of the Azure Well-Architected Framework, which is a set of guiding tenets that can be used to improve the quality of a workload. For more information, see [Microsoft Azure Well-Architected Framework](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/architecture/framework).

### Reliability

Reliability ensures your application can meet the commitments you make to your customers. For more information, see [Overview of the reliability pillar](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/architecture/framework/resiliency/overview).

* Define Pod resource requests and limits in application deployment manifests, and enforce with Azure Policy.
* Separate applications to dedicated machine sets based on specific requirements.

#### Availability

This reference architecture is designed to provide high availability through availability zone infrastructure. When implemented properly this architecture provides excellent availability for lower cost and operational overhead than other solutions. The risk of a zone failure in an Azure region is mitigated by this design, since zone-redundant services are designed to withstand a zonal failure while still operating within the defined SLA.

Regional failures are unlikely, but are possible. Region failures are where services are unavailable throughout all availability zones within a region. It's important to understand the types of risks that you mitigate by using multi-zone and multi-region architectures.

Mitigate the risk of region failure by combining this zone-redundant architecture with a multi-region architecture. You should understand how to plan your multi-region architecture to reduce your solution's recovery time if an entire region is unavailable.

Multi-region designs are more complex and often more expensive than multi-zone designs within a single region, but provide an opportunity to  further optimize availability and overall reliability.

> [!NOTE]
> You should perform a risk assessment to determine if a [multi-region architecture](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/architecture/reference-architectures/containers/aks-mission-critical/mission-critical-intro) is required for your solution.

#### Resilience

Multi-zone designs based on availability zones offer levels of availability and resilience that meet or exceed the business requirements of most customers. However, for customers who want to replicate data to a secondary region for disaster recovery, the options you have available depend on the Azure services that you use.

For example, Azure Storage supports [object replication for block blobs][object-replication]. Azure data services like Cosmos DB also offer replication of data to other Azure regions with continuous backup. You can use these features to restore your solution if a disaster occurs. For more information, see [Continuous backup with point-in-time restore in Azure Cosmos DB][cosmos-continuous-backup].

#### Global services

Failures in global services like Azure Front Door and Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) are rare, but the impact can be high. Improve recovery by preparing and rehearsing runbooks to be used if failure occurs.

For example, Front Door service downtime may be reduced with a runbook that deploys an [Azure Application Gateway][appgw] and changes DNS records, redirecting traffic until Front Door service is restored.

See also this important guidance for increasing resilience to Azure AD failures by [building resilience in identity and access management infrastructure][aad-resilience].

### Security

Security provides assurances against deliberate attacks and the abuse of your valuable data and systems. For more information, see [Overview of the security pillar](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/architecture/framework/security/overview).

* Consider deploying a private cluster
* Private endpoints are used on Azure services that don't need to be accessed from the public internet.
* All service-to-service communication in Azure is TLS (transport layer security) encrypted by default. Azure Front Door should be configured to accept HTTPS traffic only, and the minimum TLS version set.
* Managed identities are used for authenticating Azure service-to-service communication, where available. For more information about managed identities, see [What are managed identities for Azure resources?](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview).
* To manage and protect secrets, certificates, and connection strings in your cluster, consider connecting Azure Red Hat OpenShift cluster to Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes and use the Azure Key Vault Secrets Provider extension to fetch secrets.
* Configure Microsoft Defender for Containers supported via Arc enabled Kubernetes to secure clusters, containers, and applications. Also scan your images for vulnerabilities with Microsoft Defender or any other image scanning solution.
* Configure Azure AD integration to use Azure AD to authenticate users in your Azure Red Hat OpenShift cluster.
* Use Microsoft Defender for Containers supported via Arc enabled Kubernetes to secure clusters, containers, and applications. Also scan your images for vulnerabilities with Microsoft Defender or any other image scanning solution.

### Cost optimization

Cost optimization is about looking at ways to reduce unnecessary expenses and improve operational efficiencies. For more information, see [Overview of the cost optimization pillar](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/architecture/framework/cost/overview).

Zone-redundant architectures are less expensive than multi-region alternatives because services can be deployed in a single region. However, there are several cost implications that customers should be aware of:

* Some zone-redundant services incur charges for inter-zone bandwidth. For more information, see [Bandwidth pricing][bandwidth-pricing].
* Some services require a minimum number of instances or replicas to be deployed to achieve zone redundancy.
* Zone-redundant storage (ZRS) is priced differently than locally redundant storage (LRS). For more information, see [Storage pricing][storage-pricing].
* Private endpoints are mostly available on Premium Azure service SKUs. Private endpoints incur hourly and bandwidth (data) charges. For more information, see [Private Link pricing][pep-pricing].

Costs can be optimized by reserving resources in advance. Several services in this architecture are eligible for reserved capacity pricing. For more information about reserved capacity, see [Reservations][reservations].

An example bill of materials for this architecture can be viewed in the [Azure pricing calculator][bom].

### Operational excellence

Operational excellence covers the operations processes that deploy an application and keep it running in production. For more information, see [Overview of the operational excellence pillar](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/architecture/framework/devops/overview).

All Azure PaaS (platform as a service) services are integrated with [Azure Monitor][azmon]. Follow [Azure monitor best practices][azmon-bp] to:

* Build a [health model](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/architecture/framework/mission-critical/mission-critical-health-modeling#video-define-a-health-model-for-your-mission-critical-workload) to quantify application health in the context of business requirements.
* Configure the right amount of log data collection.
* Create Azure Dashboards for "single pane of glass" views for operations teams.
* Create a successful alerting strategy.
* Integrate [Application Insights][insights] into apps to track application performance metrics.  
* Use an alerting system to provide notifications when things need direct action: Container Insights metric alerts or in-built Alerting UI.
* Be aware of ways to monitor and log Azure Red Hat OpenShift to gain insights into the health of your resources and to foresee potential issues.
* Review the Azure Red Hat OpenShift responsibility matrix to understand how responsibilities for clusters are shared between Microsoft, Red Hat, and customers.

Automate service deployments with [Bicep][bicep], a template language for deploying Infrastructure as Code.

[Continuously validate](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/architecture/framework/mission-critical/mission-critical-deployment-testing#video-continuously-validate-your-mission-critical-workload) the workload to test the performance and resilience of the entire solution using services such as [Azure Load Testing][load-tests] and [Azure Chaos Studio][chaos].

### Performance efficiency

Performance efficiency is the ability of your workload to scale to meet the demands placed on it by users in an efficient manner. For more information, see [Performance efficiency pillar overview](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/architecture/framework/scalability/overview).

This architecture can be highly optimized for performance and scale:

* Cache assets in Azure Front Door to distribute workloads to the Azure Microsoft Edge.
* Review [subscription limits and quotas][quotas] to ensure that services scale to demand.
* Monitor application performance using [Azure Monitor Application Insights][insights].
* Performance-test workloads to measure latency caused by cross-zone connections, if any.
* Azure Red Hat OpenShift has a rich operator ecosystem and should be used to perform and automate operational activities with efficiency and accuracy.
* Choose appropriate virtual machine sizes for your workloads, large enough to so you get the benefits of increased density, but not so large that your cluster can't handle the workload of a failing node.
* Use pod requests and limits to manage the compute resources within a cluster. Pod requests and limits inform the Kubernetes scheduler, which assigns compute resources to a pod. Restrict resource consumption in a project using limit ranges.
* Optimize the CPU and memory request values, and maximize the efficiency of the cluster resources using vertical pod autoscaler.
* Scale pods to meet demand using horizontal pod autoscaler.
* Define ClusterAutoScaler and MachineAutoScaler to scale machines when your cluster runs out of resources to support more deployments.
