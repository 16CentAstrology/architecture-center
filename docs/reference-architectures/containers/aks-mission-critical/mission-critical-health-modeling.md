# Health modeling for mission-critical workloads

Monitoring applications and infrastructure is an important part of any infrastructure deployment. For a mission-critical workload, monitoring is a critical part of the deployment. Monitoring application health and key metrics of Azure resources helps you understand if the environment is working as expected.

To fully understand these metrics and evaluate the overall health of a workload requires a holistic understanding of all of the data monitored. A health model can assist with evaluation of the overall health status by displaying a clear indication of the health of the workload instead of raw metrics. The status is often presented as "traffic light" indicators such as red, green, or yellow. Representation of a health model with clear indicators makes it intuitive for an operator to understand the overall health of the workload and respond quickly to issues that arise.

Health modeling can be expanded into the following operational tasks for the mission-critical deployment:

- **Application Health Service** - Application component on the compute cluster that provides an API to determine the health of a stamp.

- **Monitoring** - Collection of performance and application counters that evaluate the health and performance of the application and infrastructure.

- **Alerting** - Actionable alerts of issues or outages in the infrastructure and application.

- **Failure analysis** - Breakdown and analysis of any failures including documentation of root cause.

Taken together, these tasks make up a comprehensive health model for the mission-critical infrastructure. Development of a health model can and should be an exhaustive and integral part of any mission-critical deployment.

## Application Health Service

The Application Health Service (HealthService) is an application component that resides with the Catalog Service (CatalogService) and the Background Processor (BackgroundProcessor) within the compute cluster. The **HealthService** provides a REST API for Azure Front Door to call to determine the health of a stamp. The **HealthService** is a complex component that reflects the state of dependencies, in addition to it's own.

When the compute cluster is down, the health service won't respond. When the services is up and running, it performs periodic checks against the following components in the infrastructure:

- It attempts to do a simple query against Cosmos DB.

- It attempts to send a message to Event Hub. The message is filtered out by the background worker.

- It looks up a state file in the storage account. This file can be used to turn off a region, even while the other checks are still operating correctly.

All health check results are cached in memory for a configurable number of seconds, by default 10. The cached results in not every call to the API results in backend calls. This operation does add a small potential latency in detecting outages. Caching the results reduces additional cluster load generated by health checks.

### Configuration

The **HealthService** and the **CatalogService** have configuration settings common between the components except for the following settings used exclusively by the **HealthService**:

| Setting | Value |
| ------- | ----- |
| **`HealthServiceCacheDurationSeconds`** | Controls the expiration time of memory cache, in seconds. |
| **`HealthServiceStorageConnectionString`** | Connection string for the Storage Account where the status file should be present. |
| **`HealthServiceBlobContainerName`** | Storage Container where the status file should be present. |
| **`HealthServiceBlobName`** | Name of the status file - health check will look for this. |
| **`HealthServiceOverallTimeoutSeconds`** | Timeout for the whole check - defaults to 3 seconds. If the check doesn't finish in this interval, the service reports unhealthy. |

### Implementation



## Monitoring

## Alerting

## Failure analysis


## Next steps

Deploy the reference implementation to get a full understanding of the resources and their configuration used in this architecture.
