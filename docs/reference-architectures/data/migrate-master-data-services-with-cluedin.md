Master Data has been given the task to solve data quality, data governance, and mastering of the most important business data within a company. If you are currently using an on-premises or cloud-hosted SQL master data services (MDS) instance or instances, then the following scenario simplifies the experience of moving to a native Azure master data management solution by CluedIn. 

The architecture encapsulates many pillars of master data management (MDM) into a coherent, consistent, end-to-end MDM solution. CluedIn has introduced a _zero-modelling_ MDM approach that has been proven to accelerate MDM projects and increase success rates of the MDM initiatives.

CluedIn provides a side-by-side feature parity to SQL MDS that provides user-familiarity for data stewards and MDM teams to easily migrate their daily workloads from MDS to CluedIn. In addition to this, CluedIn provides many more valuable data master functionality to provide a foundation of ready-for-insight data to your business.

## Additional features

Master data services traditionally contain the following main functionality:
- Support for model versioning
- Business rules
- Data quality services
- Workflow
- Hierarchies
- Excel plugin

CluedIn provides functionality for all of the above and much more. In addition, the following use-cases are also enabled: 
  - Hierarchies can now be visualized natively in Power BI. 
  - Workflows are migrated and can be built and extended directly in Power Automate.
  - Business rules and data quality services are natively migrated into the CluedIn Rules engine. 
  - CluedIn provides built-in data enrichment for your MDS records, to automatically fix and validated addresses, company information, and more.
  - Manage consent and run data subject access requests.
  - Write back to the MDS instance, if necessary.

CluedIn also supports migrating data change history, and it can automatically build up data quality history from your MDS instances.
You can also run an MDS solution and CluedIn in-sync, if you don't want to turn your MDS instances off as soon as the migration process has finished. 

CluedIn natively supports the common data model / DataVerse, meaning that Power Apps, Power Automate, Power BI, Virtual Chatbots and Microsoft Dynamics users can all natively utilize data from CluedIn without the need for any extra setup or integration. 

### CluedIn natively integrates with Azure Purview 

Azure Purview brings Data Governance capabilities to the Microsoft Azure cloud and CluedIn provides native integration to its functionality. 
For Azure customers that need fine-grained details on the processing of data across their data estate, CluedIn writes its transformation log directly into the Purview Data Map and lineage. If you are needed to show a full end-to-end lineage of how data moves and transforms through your Azure stack, CluedIn can be utilized to write this information to Purview. 

 - The Azure Purview Glossary is available directly in CluedIn and vice-versa. 
 - CluedIn can ingest assets that have been registered in Purview. 
 - CluedIn scans the PII from Purview and can pinpoint to a record level where the PII is. It also adds supports for PII in unstructured and semi-structed data, not just structured. 
 - CluedIn will use the schema set in Purview to auto-map data sets into CluedIn. 
 - CluedIn extends the Purview Lineage with detailed processing logs. 
-	CluedIn can initiate Purview Scans before a new data ingestion is scheduled.
