Integration is the process of connecting applications, data, services, and devices, often in complex ways. Through integration, organizations bring workflows together so they're consistent and scalable. Businesses connect applications, data, and processes in a fast, efficient, and automated manner.

Connections can run between on-premises, cloud, and edge systems. They can bring together enterprise, partner, third-party, and legacy technologies.

To integrate applications, sometimes direct API calls are suitable. But sometimes technologies need to communicate asynchronously, through messaging or events. All integration processes need orchestrationâ€”a straightforward way to define and run the workflow's logic.

For data, integration provides solutions for gathering and processing data from multiple sources, in multiple formats.
