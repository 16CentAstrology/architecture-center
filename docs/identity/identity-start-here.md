# Identity architecture design

Identity solutions are part of identity and access management (IAM), a framework for protecting data and resources. In on-premises systems, internal networks provide security boundaries. Public cloud systems rely on IAM for boundary security.

IAM provides a way to identify accounts and regulate what they can do when interacting with resources. Identities exist for users like employees and students, and for non-human entities like devices, applications, and service principles. IAM includes components that support the authentication and authorization of these identities. Authentication identifies users. Authorization determines what users can do in applications.

Azure offers a comprehensive set of services, tools, and reference architectures for developing secure, operationally efficient identity solutions.

## Introduction to identity on Azure

If you're new to IAM, the best place to start is with Microsoft Learn. Microsoft Learn is a free, online training platform. You'll find videos, tutorials, and hands-on learning for specific products and services. The following resources can help you build foundational knowledge of IAM and take you through core concepts.

## Path to production

After you understand the importance of identity management, the next step is to design your solution. This process involves comparing products and services while determining which components to use. To explore options for implementing identity capabilities, consult these resources:

When you've decided on an approach, implementing your solution comes next. To learn how to deploy identity solutions, use these resources:
