# Choose an Azure compute option for microservices

The term *compute* refers to the hosting model for the computing resources that your application runs on. This article aims to provide prescriptive guidance to choose a compute platform for microservices. The choice of microservice compute platform may vary based on more nuanced requirements.

For a microservices architecture, two approaches are especially popular:

- Microservices deployed on dedicated compute platforms, typically leveraging a microservice orchestrator.
- Microservices deployed on serverless platform.

While these aren't the only options, they are both proven approaches to building microservices. An application might include both approaches.

## Microservices leveraging serverless platform. 

You can leverage serverless platform for deploying Microservices on either Azure Container Apps, or on Azure Functions. Both Azure Container Apps and Azure Functions provide the option for serverless compute, where the billing is based on the volume of requests (and not on the compute consumption). Both Azure Container Apps and Azure Functions provide you the option to host the workloads on dedicated capacity as well. 

## Code based microservices vs Continerized microservices. 

If you do not wish to containerize the microservices and would like to deploy the microservice as code, you may want to choose either Azure Functions or Azure Spring Apps. Please note that the programming / scripting languages supported by Azure Functions are .NET, Java, Node.js, Python and PowerShell Core. For microservices developed in other languages, you may want to implement a custom handler in Azure function or consider containerizing the application. 

## Microservices leveraging GPU

If the microservice requires GPU capacity (for example, to execute machine learning tasks), Azure Container Apps and Azure Kubernetes Service are the platforms of choice. While Azure Kubernetes Service can leverage any GPU models in Azure, Azure Container Apps offer a subset of GPU models to select from. 


## Compute platform for Java Spring based microservices 

Azure Spring Apps is an ideal choice for deploying Spring based microservices. Spring Apps supports deploying both code based and container based spring microservices. You can also deploy spring based microservices in Azure functions, or deploy spring containers in other orchestrator based compute platforms such as Azure Kubernetes Services or Azure Container Apps as well. Compared to other computing choices, Azure Spring Apps provides certain advantages to deploying Spring microservices, such as configuration management, service discovery, blue-green deployments etc. 


## Microservices leveraging service orchestrators. 

An orchestrator handles tasks related to deploying and managing a set of services. These tasks include placing services on nodes, monitoring the health of services, restarting unhealthy services, load balancing network traffic across service instances, service discovery, scaling the number of instances of a service, and applying configuration updates. Popular orchestrators include Kubernetes, Service Fabric, DC/OS, and Docker Swarm.

On the Azure platform, consider the following options:

- [Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)](/azure/aks/) is a managed Kubernetes service. AKS provisions Kubernetes and exposes the Kubernetes API endpoints, hosts and manages the Kubernetes control plane, performing automated upgrades, automated patching, autoscaling, and other management tasks. Azure Kubernetes Service provides you direct access to Kubernetes APIs. 

- [Azure Container Apps](/azure/container-apps) is a managed service built on Kubernetes that abstracts the complexities of container orchestration and other management tasks. Container Apps simplifies the deployment and management of containerized applications and microservices in a serverless environment while providing the features of Kubernetes. Azure Container Apps is ideal for scenarios where direct access to Kubernetes APIs are not required. 

- [Azure Spring Apps](/azure/spring-apps/) is a fully managed service that helps Spring developers focus on code, not on infrastructure. You can deploy any type of Spring appâ€”including web apps, microservices, event-driven, serverless, and batch in Azure Spring Apps environment.  Azure Spring Apps provides lifecycle management using comprehensive monitoring and diagnostics, configuration management, service discovery, CI/CD integration, blue-green deployments, and more.

- [Service Fabric](/azure/service-fabric/) is a distributed systems platform for packaging, deploying, and managing microservices. Microservices can be deployed to Service Fabric as containers, as binary executables, or as [Reliable Services](/azure/service-fabric/service-fabric-reliable-services-introduction). Using the Reliable Services programming model, services can directly use Service Fabric programming APIs to query the system, report health, receive notifications about configuration and code changes, and discover other services. 

- Other options such as Docker Enterprise Edition can run in an IaaS environment on Azure. You can find deployment templates on [Azure Marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com).

### Microservices leveraging Kubernetes APIs

Access to Kubernetes APIs is another deciding factor - Azure Kubernetes Service provides direct access to Kubernetes APIs, while Azure Container Apps does not. Azure Container Apps hides the complexities of Kubernetes and simplifies the container deployment experience. However, if the microservice is designed to directly interact with Kubernetes APIs, Azure Kubernetes Service may be the right choice. 



There may be additional decision factors such as use of GPUs, whether the microservice code is packaged as containers, whether they leverage frameworks such as Java Springboot etc. 











## Orchestrator or serverless?

Here are some factors to consider when choosing between an orchestrator approach and a serverless approach.

**Manageability** A serverless application is easy to manage, because the platform manages all compute resources for you. While an orchestrator abstracts some aspects of managing and configuring a cluster, it does not completely hide the underlying VMs. With an orchestrator, you will need to think about issues such as load balancing, CPU and memory usage, and networking.

**Flexibility and control**. An orchestrator gives you a great deal of control over configuring and managing your services and the cluster. The tradeoff is additional complexity. With a serverless architecture, you give up some degree of control because these details are abstracted.

**Portability**. All of the orchestrators listed here (Kubernetes, DC/OS, Docker Swarm, and Service Fabric) can run on-premises or in multiple public clouds.

**Application integration**. It can be challenging to build a complex application using a serverless architecture, due to the need to coordinate, deploy, and manage many small independent functions. One option in Azure is to use [Azure Logic Apps](/azure/logic-apps/) to coordinate a set of Azure Functions. For an example of this approach, see [Create a function that integrates with Azure Logic Apps](/azure/azure-functions/functions-twitter-email).

**Cost**. With an orchestrator, you pay for the VMs that are running in the cluster. With a serverless application, you pay only for the actual compute resources consumed. In both cases, you need to factor in the cost of any additional services, such as storage, databases, and messaging services.

**Scalability**. Azure Functions scales automatically to meet demand, based on the number of incoming events. Azure Kubernetes Service provides auto-scaling capabilities for the underlying virtual machines (node autoscaler), and auto-scaling for containers (horizontal pod autoscaler & vertical pod autoscaler) as well.
