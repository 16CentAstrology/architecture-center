Azure Container Instances

This reference architecture shows a multi-agent AI automation system deployed using Azure container services and AI platforms. It describes a foundational configuration that leverages specialized AI agents to coordinate and execute complex organizational tasks automatically. This article assumes that you have a basic understanding of containerized applications and AI orchestration concepts. The article primarily highlights the infrastructure and DevOps aspects of how to manage multi-agent systems on Azure, including continuous integration, data persistence, and agent coordination. For more information about designing AI agent architectures, see Multi-agent systems design patterns.
The architecture demonstrates how to build scalable automation pipelines where multiple AI agents collaborate through a central API orchestrator, with persistent learning capabilities and automated deployment processes for enterprise-grade task automation.

) of this architecture.*

### Workflow
The following workflow corresponds to the preceding diagram:
1. User Input & Task Specification: Users access the Web Front-end to request and manage automated solutions
Tasks are submitted through the web interface with specific requirements and parameters

2. Task Processing & Orchestration: App Service Website receives the user request from the frontend
Container App API processes the incoming task and determines which specialized AI agents are needed
Task is broken down into component parts for multi-agent coordination

3. Agent Coordination & AI Processing: Container App API connects to Azure AI Foundry GPT-4o model
Multiple specialized AI agents are orchestrated to handle different aspects of the task
Agents collaborate to plan, execute, and validate the automated solution

4. Data Storage & Retrieval: Azure Cosmos DB stores all data related to current and past plans/solutions
Historical task data and patterns are maintained for learning and optimization
Agent decisions and outcomes are persisted for future reference

5. Container Management & Deployment: Container Registry manages images for frontend website and backend API
Ensures consistent deployment of agent services across environments
Maintains versioned container images for rollback capabilities

6. CI/CD Pipeline & Automation: Source Repository (GitHub) triggers automatic updates when code changes
Docker builds and deploys updated container images to the registry
Website and API server images are generated automatically on code updates
Continuous integration ensures rapid deployment of improvements


### Components

- [Azure App Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/app-service/) is a platform as a service (PaaS) solution that provides a scalable web hosting environment for applications. In this architecture, App Service Website serves as the frontend interface where users can request and manage automated solutions, providing a responsive web experience for task submission and monitoring.

- [Azure Container App](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/container-apps/)is a serverless container platform that enables you to run microservices and containerized applications on a serverless platform. In this architecture, the Container App API serves as the central orchestration layer that processes user requests, coordinates multiple AI agents, and manages the execution of complex automated tasks.

- [Azure AI Foundry](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/ai-foundry/) is a managed AI service that provides access to advanced language models for natural language processing and generation. In this architecture, the GPT-4o model powers the specialized AI agents that collaborate to plan, execute, and validate automated solutions based on user input and business requirements.

- [Azure Cosmos DB](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/cosmos-db/) is a globally distributed, multi-model database service that provides guaranteed low latency and elastic scalability. In this architecture, Cosmos DB stores all data related to current and past automation plans and solutions, enabling agents to learn from historical patterns and maintain consistency across task executions.

- [Azure Container Registry](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/container-registry/) is a managed Docker registry service that stores and manages container images. In this architecture, Container Registry manages images for both the frontend website and backend API, ensuring consistent deployment and version control of the multi-agent system components.



## Scenario details
The Multi-Agent Custom Automation Engine addresses the challenge of coordinating complex, multi-departmental business processes that traditionally require significant manual oversight and coordination. Organizations often struggle with tasks that span multiple domains of expertise, require consistent execution across different teams, and need to maintain audit trails for compliance purposes.

This solution leverages specialized AI agents that work collaboratively to break down complex organizational tasks into manageable components. Each agent brings domain-specific knowledge and capabilities, enabling the system to handle sophisticated workflows that would typically require human coordination across multiple departments. The architecture ensures scalability through containerized deployment, maintains learning through persistent data storage, and provides continuous improvement through automated CI/CD pipelines.
