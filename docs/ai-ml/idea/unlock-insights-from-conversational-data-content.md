### Workflow

The following workflow corresponds to the preceding diagram:

1. Raw call audio files and call transcripts exist in their source systems.

2. The audio files and transcripts are uploaded to Azure Storage Account as the initial data sources. The data processing pipeline that analyzes audio/transcript files from customer service calls and creates a searchable knowledge base begins with this ingestion phase, where audio files undergo speech-to-text conversion while text transcripts are directly processed for content analysis. This process happens daily, but your scenario might require a different frequency.

3. Azure AI Content Understanding processes both audio and text files to extract conversation details, entities, relationships, and contextual information. This service performs topic modeling and key phrase extraction to identify meaningful patterns within the conversational data, including call-specific elements such as resolution status, customer satisfaction indicators, and compliance markers.

4. Extracted entities and processed conversation data are stored in Azure SQL Database for structured queries, while Azure AI Search creates vectorized representations of call transcripts, enabling semantic search capabilities across the conversation corpus with support for complex queries about call outcomes, agent performance, and customer sentiment trends.

5. The orchestration layer within Azure App Service coordinates the overall workflow, managing data flow between services and providing API endpoints. This orchestration integrates Azure OpenAI models in AI Foundry and Semantic Kernel for intelligent processing and response generation, utilizing function calling capabilities to enhance the conversation analysis workflow.

6. Users access a web frontend hosted on Azure App Service to explore call insights, chat with the data using natural language queries, and generate visualizations. The interface provides conversational access to the processed knowledge base, enabling queries like "Show me all unresolved billing complaints from last month" or "What are the most common reasons for escalations?"

7. Azure Cosmos DB stores chat history and session data, maintaining conversation context for the interactive frontend experience and enabling persistent user sessions across the application.
