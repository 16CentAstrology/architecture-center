Intelligent applications that use Azure OpenAI services through platform-native Azure deployments offer a seamless user authentication and authorization approach for developers. However, edge case scenarios present unique complexities that require additional architecture designs. Scenarios include topologies such as non-Azure hosted applications, the use of external identity providers, or deploying multiple clients accessing the same Azure OpenAI instances. In these scenarios, introducing a gateway in front of Azure OpenAI can provide significant improvement with a layer of security that ensures consistency in authentication to deployed instances. 

This article explores the following key scenarios when authenticating with Azure OpenAI services. 
- Client applications authenticated with an external identity provider 

- Client applications authenticated with certificates 

- Multiple client applications accessing a shared Azure OpenAI instance 

- Client applications accessing multiple Azure OpenAI instances

Each scenario describes the challenges that they introduce, and the benefits introduced by including a gateway. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The following guidance is suitable for any gateway implementation, including Azure API Management. The architecture diagrams represent the component generically in most scenarios to illustrate this. 

## Client applications authenticated with an external identity provider

### Scenario use cases for external identity providers

In the scenario where a user operates an intelligent application that employs an external Identity Provider (IdP), like Okta or Auth0, the authentication process may differ. If the application is not hosted within Azure, the use of managed identities for authentication is not possible. In this case, API keys become essential as they offer a secure and straightforward method for these external applications to interact with Azure OpenAI, facilitating effective tracking and control of API usage. 

When designing an architecture for accessing Azure OpenAI services, the following use cases may apply: 

- User authentication is managed by a Microsoft Entra ID tenant external to the Azure OpenAI instance. 

- User authentication is managed by an external OpenID Connect (OIDC) enabled identity provider, such as Okta or Auth0. 

### Introduce a gateway to improve Azure OpenAI access security and maintainability 

Introducing a gateway in this scenario allows server-side control to authorize access to Azure OpenAI using a managed identity regardless of the user authentication mechanism via an identity provider. The managed identity eliminates the need to manage API keys for Azure OpenAI instances in client application code, while improving security using Azure role-based access control (RBAC). 

Using a gateway in this scenario, it will validate the authenticated user access tokens, such as a JSON Web Token (JWT), generated by the identity provider before granting authorization to the backing Azure OpenAI instance. When authenticating with Azure OpenAI, the gateway uses its assigned managed identity with least-privileged role-assignment to make requests for completions. 

#### Tips for client applications authenticated with external identity providers  

- Additional client scopes can be added to your application registration in your identity provider to enable granular permission to consumers. These scopes allow client applications to request permission to perform specific operations in your gateway, including access to Azure OpenAI. 

- This scenario is straightforward to configure using inbound policies in Azure API Management with the validate-jwt policy to enforce the existence and validity of a supported JWT. 


#### Reasons to avoid a gateway for client applications authenticated with external identity providers 

When implementing a single, Azure deployed client application to access Azure OpenAI, configuration of user authentication and authorization may be easier within the application than at the gateway level. With this approach, your Azure deployed application can also be assigned the necessary RBAC to securely authenticate with Azure OpenAI directly. 

### User Authentication and Authorization via Microsoft Entra ID

Microsoft Entra ID is an identity and access management system that registers applications to establish a trust relationship between the application and the identity provider. The registration process is essential whether the application is a client application like a web or mobile app, or a web API (e.g. Azure OpenAI) backing a client app.

Scopes can be added to provide granular permission to consumers. These scopes allow client applications to request permission to perform operations defined by the web API.

> [!NOTE]
> To register your API and Client applications, follow [this guide](/entra/identity-platform/quickstart-configure-app-expose-web-apis) to expose the scope and grant permission to the API application.

### Azure API Management configuration for establishing authorization to Azure OpenAI Service

1. To access deployed Azure OpenAI Service instances, backends are required for each deployment. These will be referenced in the API Management policy for the Azure OpenAI API.

    :::image type="content" source="_images/openai-gateway-custom-authentication-apim-backend.png" lightbox="_images/openai-gateway-custom-authentication-apim-backend.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing configurations for Azure OpenAI backends in Azure API Management.":::

    ```xml
    <policies>
      <inbound>
        <set-backend-service backend-id="openai-backend-name" />
      </inbound>
    </policies>
    ```

    *Figure 4: Backend configuration for deployed Azure OpenAI Service.*

1. To provide a consistent API layer in Azure API Management for Azure OpenAI service deployments, the OpenAPI specification needs to be imported that targets the API version of Azure OpenAI that you are using.

    :::image type="content" source="_images/openai-gateway-custom-authentication-apim-api-spec.png" lightbox="_images/openai-gateway-custom-authentication-apim-api-spec.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing configurations for importing Azure OpenAI API specifications in Azure API Management.":::

> The latest Azure OpenAI Service OpenAPI specifications can be found on [GitHub here](https://github.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs/tree/main/specification/cognitiveservices/data-plane/AzureOpenAI/inference).

1. As well as user access token validation, we recommend [using a subscription key in addition](/azure/api-management/authentication-authorization-overview). On its own, a subscription key isn't a strong form of authentication, but it can be useful in scenarios, for example, tracking API usage or granting access to specific APIs.

    :::image type="content" source="_images/openai-gateway-custom-authentication-apim-subscriptions.png" lightbox="_images/openai-gateway-custom-authentication-apim-subscriptions.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing configurations for subscriptions to Azure OpenAI APIs in Azure API Management.":::
    *Figure 6: Subscription configuration for Azure OpenAI API access via a subscription key header.*

1. To validate the user's access token, the inbound policies requires the [validate-jwt policy](/azure/api-management/validate-jwt-policy) to enforce the existence and validity of a supported JSON Web Token (JWT) extracted from a specified HTTP header, query parameter, or a specific value.

    ```xml
    <policies>
      <inbound>
        <validate-jwt header-name="Authorization" failed-validation-httpcode="401" failed-validation-error-message="Unauthorized. Access token is missing or invalid.">
          <openid-config url="https://login.microsoftonline.com/{tenant-id}/v2.0/.well-known/openid-configuration" />
          <audiences>
            <audience>api://{app-client-id}</audience>
          </audiences>
          <issuers>
            <issuer>https://sts.windows.net/{tenant-id}/</issuer>
          </issuers>
        </validate-jwt>
      </inbound>
    </policies>
    ```

### Configuring Azure API Management to authenticate with Azure OpenAI Service using Managed Identity

1. For Azure API Management to call the Azure OpenAI Service APIs without API keys, the system-assigned managed identity must be enabled. This will provide you with an Object ID that you can associate with your Azure OpenAI Service instances.

    :::image type="content" source="_images/openai-gateway-custom-authentication-apim-system-managed-identity.png" lightbox="_images/openai-gateway-custom-authentication-apim-system-managed-identity.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing configuration for system assigned managed identity in Azure API Management.":::
    *Figure 8: System assigned managed identity configuration for Azure API Management.*

1. From your Azure OpenAI Service instances, using access control (IAM), create a role assignment for your Azure API Management managed identity with the role **Cognitive Services OpenAI User**.

    :::image type="content" source="_images/openai-gateway-custom-authentication-apim-managed-identity-role-assignment.png" lightbox="_images/openai-gateway-custom-authentication-apim-managed-identity-role-assignment.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing adding a role assignment for the system assigned managed identity in Azure API Management.":::
    *Figure 9: Add least-privileged role assignment to Azure API Management's managed identity scoped to the Azure OpenAI resource.*

1. To authenticate with the Azure OpenAI Service, an access token must be provided in the Authorization header of the request to the API endpoints. In the inbound policy of the Azure OpenAI API in Azure API Management, the authentication-managed-identity policy in conjunction with the set-header policy to ensure the request is authenticated.

    ```xml
    <policies>
      <inbound>
        <authentication-managed-identity resource="https://cognitiveservices.azure.com" output-token-variable-name="msi-access-token" ignore-error="false" />
        <set-header name="Authorization" exists-action="override">
          <value>@("Bearer " + (string)context.Variables["msi-access-token"])</value>
        </set-header>
      </inbound>
    </policies>
    ```

## Scenario considerations

With a well-configured Azure OpenAI gateway in place, let's consider additional points to aid in achieving the successful outcome objectives within this scenario.

### User-assigned managed identity

An alternative approach to implementing the managed identity for Azure API Management is to use a user assigned. Unlike the system-assigned managed identity, which is managed for you by Azure, user-assigned managed identity allows you to create and manage it. This gives you more control over the identity implementation and its assigned roles.

To implement this approach, you need to create the user assigned managed identity within your resource group and assign it the same Cognitive Services OpenAI User role to the Azure OpenAI instances. The user-assigned managed identity has an associated client ID that is needed for configuring the authentication-managed-identity policy in Azure API Management. This must be set as the client-id parameter.

```xml
<policies>
  <inbound>
    <authentication-managed-identity resource="https://cognitiveservices.azure.com" client-id="00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000" output-token-variable-name="msi-access-token" ignore-error="false" />
    <set-header name="Authorization" exists-action="override">
      <value>@("Bearer " + (string)context.Variables["msi-access-token"])</value>
    </set-header>
  </inbound>
</policies>
```

*Figure 11: Code snippet to implement authentication to Azure OpenAI service using a user-assigned managed identity in Azure API ManagementAPI policies.*

Using a user assigned managed identity can provide more flexibility and control over the authentication process. However, it also requires additional management and configuration on your part.

### External identity providers

In scenarios where you already have an existing external identity provider, enabling the use of Microsoft Entra ID to build an identity platform for your application is not be feasible. Taking advantage of your existing identity platform ensures that your team feel familiar with their tools to focus on building core functionality.

When working with external OpenID Connect (OIDC) supported identity providers, ensure that a client is configured within that identity provider. This is equivalent to configuring your application within Microsoft Entra ID, discussed in the scenario. With this configured, configuring the validate-jwt policy requires configuration for the external well-known OpenID configuration path.  

```xml
<policies>
  <inbound>
    <validate-jwt header-name="Authorization" failed-validation-httpcode="401" failed-validation-error-message="Unauthorized. Access tokenis missing or invalid.">
      <openid-config url="{external-identity-provider-well-known-openid-path}" />
    </validate-jwt>
  </inbound>
</policies>
```

Additional configuration for required claims can be provided the same as the scenario solution.
