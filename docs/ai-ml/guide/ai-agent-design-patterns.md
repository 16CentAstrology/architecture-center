# AI agent orchestration patterns

AI agent systems are becoming increasingly sophisticated, moving beyond single-agent implementations to multi-agent orchestrations that can handle complex, collaborative tasks. This guide examines fundamental orchestration patterns for multi-agent architectures, helping you choose the right approach for your specific requirements.

## Overview

Using multiple AI agents enables you to break down complex problems into specialized components, each handled by dedicated agents with specific capabilities. This approach offers several advantages over monolithic single-agent solutions:

- **Specialization**: Each agent can focus on a specific domain or capability
- **Scalability**: Add or modify agents without redesigning the entire system
- **Resilience**: Failure in one agent doesn't necessarily break the entire workflow, unless you've deemed it critical
- **Maintainability**: Smaller surface area to test and debug

The patterns described in this guide represent proven approaches to orchestrating multiple agents, each optimized for different types of coordination requirements. These AI agent orchestration patterns complement and extend traditional [cloud design patterns](/azure/architecture/patterns/) by addressing the unique challenges of coordinating intelligent, autonomous components in AI-driven workload capabilities.

## Concurrent orchestration

The concurrent orchestration pattern executes multiple agents simultaneously on the same task, allowing each agent to provide independent analysis or processing from their unique perspective or specialization.

:::image type="complex" source="_images/concurrent-pattern.svg" alt-text="Diagram showing concurrent orchestration where multiple agents process the same input task simultaneously and their results are aggregated." lightbox="_images/concurrent-pattern.svg":::
The diagram illustrates concurrent orchestration with a single input task at the top center. Three agent boxes (Agent A - Security Specialist, Agent B - Performance Analyst, Agent C - Documentation Expert) are positioned horizontally below the input, each connected to the input task with parallel arrows showing simultaneous processing. Each agent produces its specialized output (Security Assessment, Performance Analysis, Documentation Review), shown as output boxes below each agent. All three outputs converge through arrows into a central Aggregation Component, which produces a final Combined Result at the bottom. This demonstrates how diverse agent specializations work in parallel on the same task to provide comprehensive analysis.
:::image-end:::

This pattern addresses scenarios where you need diverse insights or approaches to the same problem. Instead of sequential processing, all agents work in parallel, reducing overall execution time while providing comprehensive coverage of the problem space. This pattern is similar to the fan-out/fan-in cloud design pattern.

### When to use concurrent orchestration

Consider the concurrent orchestration pattern when you have:

- Tasks that benefit from multiple independent perspectives
- Agents with different specializations that can all contribute to the same problem
- Time-sensitive scenarios where parallel processing reduces latency
- Validation requirements where multiple agents can cross-check results
- Analysis tasks requiring diverse expertise (technical, business, creative, and so on)

### When to avoid concurrent orchestration

Avoid this pattern when:

- Agents need to build upon each other's work or each other's cumulative context sequentially
- The task requires a specific order of operations or deterministic, reproducible results from being run in specific sequence
- Resource constraints, such as model quota, make parallel execution inefficient or impossible
- Agents cannot reliable coordinate changes to shared state as they run simultaneously
- There is no clear conflict resolution strategy to handle conflicting or contradictory results from each agent
- Result aggregation logic would be too complex or would lower the quality of the results

### Concurrent orchestration examples

**Code review validation**: A software development platform uses concurrent agents where security, performance, style, and documentation agents simultaneously analyze the same code submission. Each provides independent assessments that are aggregated into a comprehensive review dashboard, reducing overall processing time while ensuring thorough coverage.

**Investment research analysis**: A financial services firm deploys concurrent agents where fundamental, technical, sentiment, and ESG agents simultaneously analyze the same stock from their specialized perspectives, providing diverse, time-sensitive insights for rapid investment decisions.

### Implement concurrent orchestration

For Semantic Kernel based implementations, see [Concurrent Orchestration in Semantic Kernel](/semantic-kernel/frameworks/agent/agent-orchestration/concurrent).

## Sequential orchestration

The sequential orchestration pattern chains agents together in a predefined order, where each agent processes the output from the previous agent in the sequence, creating a pipeline of specialized transformations.

:::image type="complex" source="_images/sequential-pattern.svg" alt-text="Diagram showing sequential orchestration where agents process tasks in a defined pipeline order with output flowing from one agent to the next." lightbox="_images/sequential-pattern.svg":::
The diagram shows a vertical pipeline representing sequential orchestration. At the top, an input document flows into Agent A (Document Summarizer), which processes it and passes its output downward to Agent B (Language Translator). Agent B then processes the summary and passes its translated output to Agent C (Quality Reviewer) at the bottom. Each agent is represented as a processing box with clear input/output arrows showing the linear flow. The final output emerges from Agent C, demonstrating how each agent builds upon the previous agent's work in a predetermined sequence to progressively refine and enhance the result.
:::image-end:::

This pattern solves problems that require step-by-step processing, where each stage builds upon the previous one. It's ideal for workflows with clear dependencies and where the output quality improves through progressive refinement. This pattern is similar to the [Pipes and Filters](/azure/architecture/patterns/pipes-and-filters) cloud design pattern, but with AI agents rather than custom-coded processing components.

### When to use sequential orchestration

Consider the sequential orchestration pattern when you have:

- Multi-stage processes with clear dependencies and predictable workflow progression
- Data transformation pipelines, where each stage adds specific value that the next stage depends on
- Progressive refinement requirements, like "draft, review, polish" workflows
- Need to add a human-in-the-loop quality gate between steps in a process
- A system where the availability and performance characteristics of every agent in the pipeline is understood. Failures or delays in one agent's processing are tolerable for the pipeline.

### When to avoid sequential orchestration

Avoid this pattern when:

- Stages could be parallelized without impact to quality results
- Early stages might fail or produce low-quality output and there is no reasonable way to prevent future steps from processing against on accumulated errors
- Agents need to collaborate rather than hand off work
- The workflow requires backtracking or iteration
- Dynamic routing based on intermediate results is needed

### Sequential orchestration examples

**Legal contract drafting**: A law firm's document management software uses sequential agents where each stage requires the complete output from the previous stage: template creation, clause customization, regulatory compliance review, risk assessment. Each agent builds upon the work of the previous agent to create a comprehensive contract.

**Personalized curriculum development**: An educational technology company uses sequential agents to build individualized training programs: learning assessment, content mapping, pedagogical sequencing, student task scheduling. Each step depends on the complete output from the previous stage to create an effective learning experience.

### Implement sequential orchestration

For Semantic Kernel based implementations, see [Concurrent Orchestration in Semantic Kernel](/semantic-kernel/frameworks/agent/agent-orchestration/sequential).

## Group chat orchestration

The group chat orchestration enables multiple agents to participate in a shared conversation thread, where agents collaborate through discussion to solve problems, make decisions, or validate work. A chat manager coordinates the flow, determining which agent should respond next and managing different interaction modes from collaborative brainstorming to structured quality gates.

:::image type="complex" source="_images/group-chat-pattern.svg" alt-text="Diagram showing group chat orchestration where multiple agents participate in a managed conversation with a central chat manager coordinating the discussion flow." lightbox="_images/group-chat-pattern.svg":::
The diagram illustrates group chat orchestration with a central shared conversation thread at the top, represented as a chat bubble or message area. Below it, a Group Chat Manager is positioned centrally as the orchestration hub. Four participants are arranged around the manager: Agent A (Market Research), Agent B (Financial Analysis), Agent C (Risk Assessment), and a Human Participant (Strategy Director). Bidirectional arrows connect each participant to the chat manager, showing how the manager coordinates turn-taking and message flow. Speech bubbles or message indicators show the collaborative nature of the conversation, with the chat manager ensuring orderly discussion flow and determining when each participant should contribute to the shared conversation thread.
:::image-end:::

This pattern addresses scenarios requiring multi-agent discussion to reach decisions, whether through collaborative ideation, structured validation, or quality control processes. It supports various interaction modes from free-flowing brainstorming to formal review workflows with fixed roles and approval gates.

### When to use group chat orchestration

Consider group chat orchestration when you have any of the following scenarios.

#### Collaborative scenarios

- Creative brainstorming sessions where agents build on each other's ideas
- Decision-making processes that benefit from debate and consensus-building
- Complex analysis requiring iterative refinement through discussion
- Multi-disciplinary problems requiring cross-functional dialogue

#### Validation and quality control scenarios

- Quality assurance requirements with structured review processes
- Compliance and regulatory validation requiring multiple expert perspectives
- Financial or high-risk decisions needing approval workflows with clear audit trails
- Content creation requiring editorial review with separation of concerns between creation and validation

#### General discussion scenarios

- Scenarios where human oversight or participation is needed within agent collaboration
- Problems requiring multiple expert perspectives to converge through conversation
- Situations where the decision-making process itself needs to be transparent and auditable

### When to avoid group chat orchestration

Avoid this pattern when:

- Simple task delegation or linear pipeline processing is sufficient
- Single agent processing can adequately handle the requirements
- Real-time processing requirements make discussion overhead unacceptable
- Clear hierarchical decision-making without discussion is more appropriate
- Communication overhead would overwhelm the benefits
- Managing conversation flow and preventing infinite loops would be too complex
- Deterministic workflows are required without any iterative discussion

### Group chat orchestration examples

**Collaborative business strategy planning**: A consulting firm uses group chat orchestration where market research, financial analysis, and competitive intelligence agents collaborate in a shared discussion to develop comprehensive business strategies. The agents build on each other's insights, debate different market approaches, and iteratively refine strategic recommendations through open conversation, with a human strategy director participating to provide industry expertise and guide the collaborative process.

**Financial transaction approval workflow**: An investment bank uses group chat orchestration for high-value transactions where a deal structuring agent presents proposed arrangements, while risk assessment and compliance agents participate in a structured discussion. The chat manager enforces a formal approval workflow where each reviewing agent must explicitly approve or reject with detailed reasoning, ensuring no transaction proceeds without proper validation and creating full audit trails for regulatory compliance.

## Handoff orchestration

The handoff orchestration enables dynamic delegation of tasks between agents, where each agent can assess the task at hand and decide whether to handle it themselves or transfer it to a more appropriate agent based on the context and requirements.

:::image type="complex" source="_images/handoff-pattern.svg" alt-text="Diagram showing handoff orchestration where a triage agent intelligently routes tasks to appropriate specialist agents based on dynamic analysis." lightbox="_images/handoff-pattern.svg":::
The diagram depicts handoff orchestration with an input task at the top flowing into a central Triage Agent (Router). The triage agent analyzes the incoming task and has decision pathways leading to three specialist agents positioned horizontally below: Specialist Agent A (Technical Support), Specialist Agent B (Billing Resolution), and Specialist Agent C (Network Diagnostics). Each specialist connects to its respective output area. Decision indicators or routing symbols show how the triage agent evaluates task requirements and selects the most appropriate specialist. Only the selected specialist agent is highlighted or activated for each specific task, demonstrating intelligent dynamic routing based on content analysis rather than predetermined rules.
:::image-end:::

This pattern addresses scenarios where the optimal agent for a task isn't known upfront, or where the task requirements become clear only during processing. It enables intelligent routing and ensures tasks reach the most capable agent.

### When to use handoff orchestration

Consider the agent handoff pattern when you have:

- Agents with specialized knowledge or tools, but the number of or order of those agents cannot be pre-determined
- Scenarios where expertise requirements emerge during processing resulting in dynamic task routing based on content analysis
- Multi-domain problems requiring different specialists

### When to avoid handoff orchestration

Avoid this pattern when:

- The appropriate agent is always known upfront
- Task routing is simple and rule-based
- Decision-making and handoff overhead exceeds the benefits of specialization
- Suboptimal routing decisions would lead to poor user experience
- The problem could result in infinite handoff loops

### Agent handoff pattern examples

**Scientific research analysis**: A research institution uses handoff agents where an initial data processing agent analyzes experimental results but discovers specialized interpretation needs that only emerge during analysis. Statistical anomalies get handed off to methodology validation specialists, unexpected correlations to theoretical modeling agents, demonstrating how the initial agent cannot predetermine which specialist is needed.

**Dynamic customer service escalation**: A telecommunications CRM solution uses handoff agents where a general support agent begins helping customers but discovers specialized expertise needs through conversation. Network issues get handed off to technical infrastructure agents, billing disputes to financial resolution agents, with handoffs occurring when the current agent recognizes capability limits.

## Magnetic orchestration

The magnetic orchestration pattern combines the flexibility of autonomous agent collaboration with the structure of a central orchestrator. A lead agent (the "magnetizer") coordinates and directs specialized agents while allowing them to communicate directly with each other when needed, creating a dynamic balance between centralized control and distributed collaboration.

:::image type="complex" source="_images/magnetic-pattern.svg" alt-text="Diagram showing magnetic orchestration where a lead agent coordinates specialized agents while allowing flexible direct communication between specialists." lightbox="_images/magnetic-pattern.svg":::
The diagram illustrates magnetic orchestration with a Lead Agent (Magnetizer) positioned at the top center as the primary coordinator. Below it, three specialist agents are arranged horizontally: Agent A (Customer Data), Agent B (Technical Systems), and Agent C (Business Logic). The lead agent has bidirectional coordination arrows connecting to each specialist, showing its oversight role. Additionally, direct communication lines connect the specialists to each other, forming a hybrid mesh structure. An input task flows to the lead agent, which can dynamically activate and coordinate the specialists. Each specialist produces specialized outputs while maintaining the ability to collaborate directly with peers when beneficial. This demonstrates the balance between centralized coordination and distributed collaboration that characterizes the magnetic pattern.
:::image-end:::

This pattern addresses complex scenarios where you need both strategic coordination and tactical flexibility. The lead agent maintains overall direction and can intervene when needed, while specialized agents can collaborate directly for efficiency. This pattern is inspired by Microsoft's MagneticOne framework and balances the benefits of centralized coordination with the agility of peer-to-peer collaboration.

### When to use magnetic orchestration

Consider magnetic orchestration when you have:

- Complex workflows requiring both centralized coordination and flexible agent collaboration
- Need for dynamic task distribution with intelligent agent selection based on task requirements
- Scenarios where specialized agents benefit from direct communication while maintaining overall coordination
- Quality control requirements that benefit from both oversight and peer validation
- Tasks requiring adaptive collaboration patterns that can't be predetermined
- Systems where agent capabilities and availability change dynamically

### When to avoid magnetic orchestration

Avoid this pattern when:

- Simple sequential or concurrent processing is sufficient for your requirements
- Strict hierarchical control is required without any peer-to-peer communication
- The overhead of managing both centralized and distributed coordination exceeds benefits
- Agent interactions are predictable and don't require dynamic collaboration patterns
- Real-time constraints make the coordination overhead unacceptable
- Simple supervisor or handoff patterns adequately address your coordination needs

### Magnetic orchestration examples

**Intelligent customer support platform**: A customer service system uses magnetic orchestration where an orchestrator agent analyzes incoming support requests and dynamically selects appropriate specialist agents. Simple billing questions activate only the billing agent, while complex technical issues might activate network, security, and account management agents together. The specialist agents can collaborate directly when needed (like security consulting with network specialists), while the orchestrator maintains overall case management and ensures resolution quality.

**Research analysis platform**: A scientific research platform uses magnetic orchestration where the orchestrator evaluates research papers and dynamically assembles relevant specialist agents. Statistical analysis papers activate methodology and data validation agents, while experimental biology papers activate domain expertise, ethical review, and replication analysis agents. The specialist agents can collaborate directly on cross-cutting concerns while the orchestrator ensures comprehensive coverage and maintains research quality standards.

## Network orchestration

The network orchestration creates interconnected agents that can communicate directly with multiple other agents, forming a mesh of collaborative relationships without strict hierarchical constraints.

:::image type="complex" source="_images/network-pattern.svg" alt-text="Diagram showing network orchestration where agents form a fully connected mesh allowing any agent to communicate directly with any other agent without central coordination." lightbox="_images/network-pattern.svg":::
The diagram shows network orchestration with four agents arranged in a diamond or square formation: Agent A (Research Lead), Agent B (Data Analyst), Agent C (Design Specialist), and Agent D (Innovation Catalyst). Every agent connects to every other agent with bidirectional communication lines, creating a complete mesh topology. An input task can enter through any agent, and multiple output streams emerge from different agents. The interconnected structure shows no central authority, with all agents having equal ability to initiate communications and form dynamic coalitions. Communication indicators or data flow symbols demonstrate how information and insights can flow freely between any agents as needed, enabling emergent collaboration patterns and innovative solutions.
:::image-end:::

This pattern addresses scenarios requiring flexible, peer-to-peer collaboration where agents need to share information, coordinate activities, or collaborate on complex problems without rigid structural constraints. This pattern shares similarities with the [Choreography](/azure/architecture/patterns/choreography) cloud design pattern, where components coordinate workflow among themselves without centralized control.

### When to use network orchestration

Consider network orchestration when you have:

- Collaborative problem-solving requiring peer interaction with maximum flexibility in agent interactions
- Scenarios where any agent might need to communicate with any other with natural collaboration and knowledge sharing
- Dynamic coalition formation for specific tasks that supports emergent behaviors and innovation
- Distributed decision-making requirements across the network
- Complex interdependencies between agent capabilities that are resilient to individual agent failures
- Innovation scenarios requiring creative collaboration

### When to avoid network orchestration

Avoid this pattern when:

- Clear hierarchical structures are more appropriate
- Simple linear or parallel processing suffices
- Communication overhead would overwhelm the benefits or high communication overhead is unacceptable
- Coordination complexity becomes unmanageable or complex coordination and synchronization would be challenging to debug and troubleshoot
- Deterministic workflows are required or behavior is difficult to predict or control
- Potential for communication loops or deadlocks is unacceptable

### Network orchestration examples

**Collaborative research discovery**: A pharmaceutical research consortium uses network agents where a molecular analysis agent discovers compounds and directly shares findings with drug interaction, clinical trial design, and regulatory pathway agents. Each agent freely collaborates with any other relevant agent as discoveries emerge, enabling rapid knowledge transfer and innovative solutions that couldn't be predicted through predetermined workflows.

**Creative content generation**: A multimedia production company uses network agents where concept, visual design, music, and narrative agents dynamically collaborate and share insights based on emerging artistic directions. All agents can form coalitions and adapt to the creative process rather than being forced through rigid structures, fostering innovation through flexible peer-to-peer collaboration.

## Combining orchestration patterns

Applications often require combining multiple orchestration patterns to address complex requirements. Here are common pattern combinations:

### Sequential orchestration with concurrent stages

Implement sequential orchestration where individual stages use concurrent processing. For example, a content creation workflow might have sequential stages (research, writing, review), but each stage could use concurrent agents with different specializations.

**When to use**: Multi-stage processes where individual stages benefit from parallel processing but overall workflow must be sequential.

**Example**: Software development pipeline where the testing stage concurrently runs unit tests, integration tests, and security scans before proceeding to deployment.

### Group chat with validation workflows

Combine group chat orchestration with structured approval workflows where multiple agents participate in discussion but follow formal validation protocols. The chat manager enforces specific roles and approval gates while maintaining the collaborative benefits of group discussion.

**When to use**: Systems requiring both collaborative analysis and mandatory validation, such as financial services or healthcare applications where expertise and compliance must be balanced.

**Example**: Insurance claims processing where multiple specialist agents (medical, legal, financial) discuss complex claims in a group chat format, but the chat manager enforces that each specialist must provide explicit approval with reasoning before final claim resolution.

### Magnetic orchestration coordinating mixed patterns

Use magnetic orchestration to coordinate different pattern types for different workload categories. The lead agent can dynamically select appropriate orchestration approaches - some tasks might follow sequential processing while others use concurrent or network orchestration patterns.

**When to use**: Complex systems handling diverse workload types that require different coordination approaches with intelligent pattern selection.

**Example**: Manufacturing quality control where a magnetic orchestrator coordinates sequential testing for safety-critical components, concurrent analysis for routine inspections, and network collaboration for complex failure investigations, adapting the coordination approach based on the specific quality requirements and available specialist agents.

## Implementation considerations

When implementing any of these agent design patterns, there are key considerations to address. If your agents are defined defined in a no/low-code environment, you might not have control over these behaviors. If your agents are defined in code using SDKs like Semantic Kernel, then you'll have more control. Consider the risk involved with lack of control in these areas in no-code agent solutions.

### Reliability

- Implement appropriate timeout and retry mechanisms
- Design graceful degradation when one or more agents within a pattern fail
- Consider circuit breaker patterns for agent dependencies

### Security

- Implement authentication and use secure networking between agents
- Consider data privacy implications of agent communications
- Design audit trails for compliance requirements

### Operational excellence

- Instrument agent interactions and handoffs
- Track performance metrics for each agent
- Monitor per agent resource utilization and bottlenecks
- Design testable interfaces for individual agents
- Implement integration tests for multi-agent workflows

### Additional design area considerations

Depending on the level of control you have in your agent implementation, consider these design areas in your architecture.

#### Agent communication

- Synchronous API calls between agents
- Event-driven architectures for loose coupling

#### State management

- Prefer stateless agents for easier scaling and recovery
- Centralized state stores for shared context
- Distributed caching for performance optimization

#### System boundaries

- Define clear interfaces between agents and external systems
- Implement proper abstraction layers for technology independence
- Plan for agent lifecycle management (start, stop, updates, scale)

#### Data flow patterns

- Request-response for synchronous interactions
- Publish-subscribe for event-driven coordination
- Streaming for continuous data processing
- Batch processing for high-volume scenarios

### Common pitfalls and anti-patterns

Avoid these common mistakes when implementing agent orchestration patterns:

#### Over-orchestration

- Creating unnecessary coordination complexity
- Using magnetic orchestration when simple sequential or concurrent orchestration suffices
- Adding agents that don't provide meaningful specialization

#### Communication overhead

- Implementing full network orchestration when simpler coordination works
- Creating chatty interfaces between agents
- Not considering latency impacts of multi-hop communication

#### State synchronization issues

- Sharing mutable state between concurrent agents
- Not handling eventual consistency in distributed scenarios
- Assuming synchronous updates across agent boundaries

#### Orchestration pattern misalignment

- Using deterministic patterns for inherently non-deterministic workflows
- Applying rigid sequential orchestration to collaborative scenarios
- Choosing network orchestration for simple linear processing

#### Scalability blind spots

- Not considering agent granularity for scaling requirements
- Creating bottlenecks in Magnetic or Handoff routing logic
- Ignoring resource constraints when choosing concurrent orchestration

## Relationship to cloud design patterns

AI agent orchestration patterns extend and complement traditional [cloud design patterns](/azure/architecture/patterns/) by addressing the unique challenges of coordinating intelligent, autonomous components. While cloud design patterns focus on structural and behavioral concerns in distributed systems, AI agent orchestration patterns specifically address the coordination of components with reasoning capabilities, learning behaviors, and non-deterministic outputs.

## Next steps

To begin implementing AI agent design patterns:

1. **Assess your requirements** using the orchestration pattern selection guide
2. **Start simple** with proven orchestration patterns before considering custom implementations
3. **Prototype and measure** different orchestration patterns for your specific use case
4. **Implement proper observability** from the beginning
5. **Plan for evolution** as your requirements and understanding mature

For hands-on implementation, explore the [Semantic Kernel multi-agent orchestration samples](https://github.com/microsoft/semantic-kernel/tree/main/python/samples/getting_started_with_agents) that demonstrate these patterns in practice.
