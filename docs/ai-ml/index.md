# Artificial intelligence (AI) architecture design

*Artificial intelligence (AI)* is a technology that allows machines to imitate intelligent human behavior. With AI, machines can analyze data to create images and videos; they can analyze and synthesize speech, as well as verbally interact in natural ways, make predictions, and generate new data.



## AI concepts

### Algorithms

*Algorithms* or *machine learning algorithms* are pieces of code that help humans explore, analyze, and find meaning in complex data sets. Each algorithm is a finite set of unambiguous step-by-step instructions that a machine can follow to achieve a certain goal. In a machine learning model, the goal is to establish or discover patterns that humans can use to make predictions or categorize information. An algorithm may describe how to determine whether a pet is a cat, dog, fish, bird, or lizard. Another far more complicated algorithm may describe how to identify a written or spoken language, analyze its words, translate them into a different language, and then check the translation for accuracy.

- [What are machine learning algorithms?](https://azure.microsoft.com/resources/cloud-computing-dictionary/what-are-machine-learning-algorithms)

### Machine learning

*Machine learning* is an AI technique that uses machine learning algorithms to create predictive models. The machine learning algorithm is used to parse data fields and to "learn" from that data by using patterns found within it to generate models. Those models are then used to make informed predictions or decisions about new data.

The predictive models are validated against known data, measured by performance metrics selected for specific business scenarios, and then adjusted as needed. This process of learning and validation is called *training*. Through periodic retraining, ML models are improved over time.

- [What is machine learning?](https://azure.microsoft.com/resources/cloud-computing-dictionary/what-is-machine-learning-platform/)


### Deep learning

*Deep learning* is a type of ML that can learn through its own data processing. Like machine learning, it also uses algorithms to analyze data, but it does by using artificial neural networks that contains many inputs, outputs, and layers of processing. Each layer can process the data in a different way, and the output of one layer becomes the input for the next. This allows deep learning to create more complex models than traditional machine learning.

- [Deep learning versus machine learning](https://azure.microsoft.com/resources/cloud-computing-dictionary/artificial-intelligence-vs-machine-learning)


### Generative AI

*Generative AI* is a form of artificial intelligence in which models are trained to generate new original content based on natural language input. With generative AI, you can describe a desired output in normal everyday language, and the model can respond by creating appropriate text, image, code, and more. One popular example of such an application is [Microsoft Copilot](https://m365.cloud.microsoft/chat/), a chatbot companion to browse the web more effectively.


### Language models

*Language models* are powerful machine learning models used for natural language processing (NLP) tasks, such as text generation and sentiment analysis. These models represent natural language based on the probability of words or sequences of words occurring in a given context.

Conventional language models have been used in supervised settings for research purposes where the models are trained on well-labeled text datasets for specific tasks. Pre-trained language models offer an accessible way to get started with AI and have become more widely used in recent years. These models are trained on large-scale text corpora from the internet using deep learning neural networks and can be fine-tuned on smaller datasets for specific tasks.

The size of a language model is determined by its number of parameters, or weights, that determine how the model processes input data and generates output. Parameters are learned during the training process by adjusting the weights within layers of the model to minimize the difference between the model's predictions and the actual data. The more parameters a model has, the more complex and expressive it is, but also the more computationally expensive it is to train and use.

In general, small language models have fewer than 10 billion parameters, and large language models have more than 10 billion parameters. For example, the new Microsoft Phi-3 model family has three versions with different sizes: mini (3.8 billion parameters), small (7 billion parameters), and medium (14 billion parameters).

- [Language model catalog](https://ai.azure.com/explore/models)

### Copilots

The availability of language models has led to the emergence of new ways to interact with applications and systems through digital copilots. Copilots are generative AI assistants that are integrated into applications often as chat interfaces. They provide contextualized support for common tasks in those applications.

[Microsoft Copilot](https://m365.cloud.microsoft/chat/) is integrated into a wide range of Microsoft applications and user experiences. It's based on an open architecture that enables third-party developers to create their own plug-ins to extend or customize the user experience with Microsoft Copilot. Additionally, third-party developers can create their own copilots using the same open architecture.

- [Microsoft Copilot Studio](/microsoft-copilot-studio/fundamentals-what-is-copilot-studio)

- [Azure AI Studio](https://azure.microsoft.com/products/ai-studio/)


### Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) 

*Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)* is an architecture that augments the capabilities of a Large Language Model (LLM) like ChatGPT by adding an information retrieval system that provides grounding data. Adding an information retrieval system gives you control over grounding data used by an LLM when it formulates a response. For an enterprise solution, RAG architecture means that you can constrain generative AI to your enterprise content sourced from vectorized documents and images, and other data formats if you have embedding models for that content.

- [Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) in Azure AI Search](/azure/search/retrieval-augmented-generation-overview)

### Automated machine learning (AutoML)

*Automated machine learning*, also referred to as automated ML or AutoML, is the process of automating the time-consuming, iterative tasks of machine learning model development. It allows data scientists, analysts, and developers to build ML models with high scale, efficiency, and productivity all while sustaining model quality.

## AI Language models

- *Large Language Models (LLMs)*, such as GPT-3, are powerful tools that can generate natural language across various domains and tasks. However, they are not perfect and have limitations and risks that need to be considered before deciding to use them for real-world use cases. For more information, see [Understanding LLMs](https://learn.microsoft.com/ai/playbook/technology-guidance/generative-ai/getting-started/use-case-recommend).

- [Phi open models](https://azure.microsoft.com/blog/new-models-added-to-the-phi-3-family-available-on-microsoft-azure/) are small, less compute-intensive models for generative AI solutions. A small language model (SLM) may be more efficient, interpretable, and explainable than a large language model. For more information, see [Smaller models might work better than LLMs](https://learn.microsoft.com/ai/playbook/technology-guidance/generative-ai/getting-started/use-case-recommend#smaller-models-might-work-better-than-llms).

-->

Although prebuilt AI is useful (and increasingly flexible), the best way to get what you need from AI is probably to build a system yourself. This is obviously a very deep and complex subject, but let's look at some basic concepts beyond what we've just covered.

### Code languages

The core concept of AI is the use of algorithms to analyze data and generate models to describe (or *score*) it in ways that are useful. Algorithms are written by developers and data scientists (and sometimes by other algorithms) using programming code. Two of the most popular programming languages for AI development are currently Python and R.

[Python](https://www.python.org/) is a general-purpose, high-level programming language. It has a simple, easy-to-learn syntax that emphasizes readability. There is no compiling step. Python has a large standard library, but it also supports the ability to add modules and packages. This encourages modularity and lets you expand capabilities when needed. There is a large and growing ecosystem of AI and ML libraries for Python, including many that are readily available in Azure.

- [`scikit-learn`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/). An open-source ML library for Python

- [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/). An open-source Python library with a rich ecosystem that can be used for deep learning, computer vision, natural language processing, and more

- [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/). An open-source symbolic math library also used for ML applications and neural networks

- [Tutorial: Apply machine learning models in Azure Functions with Python and TensorFlow](/azure/azure-functions/functions-machine-learning-tensorflow?tabs=bash)

[R is a language and environment](https://www.r-project.org/) for statistical computing and graphics. It can be used for everything from mapping broad social and marketing trends online to developing financial and climate models.

Microsoft has fully embraced the R programming language and provides many different options for R developers to run their code in Azure.

- [Tutorial: Create a logistic regression model in R with Azure Machine Learning](/azure/machine-learning/tutorial-1st-r-experiment)

### Training

Training is core to machine learning. It is the iterative process of "teaching" an algorithm to create models, which are used to analyze data and then make accurate predictions from it. In practice, this process has three general phases: training, validation, and testing.

During the training phase, a quality set of known data is tagged so that individual fields are identifiable. The tagged data is fed to an algorithm configured to make a particular prediction. When finished, the algorithm outputs a model that describes the patterns it found as a set of parameters. During validation, fresh data is tagged and used to test the model. The algorithm is adjusted as needed and possibly put through more training. Finally, the testing phase uses real-world data without any tags or preselected targets. Assuming the model's results are accurate, it is considered ready for use and can be deployed.

- [Train models with Azure Machine Learning](/azure/machine-learning/concept-train-machine-learning-model)

#### Hyperparameter tuning

*Hyperparameters* are data variables that govern the training process itself. They are configuration variables that control how the algorithm operates. Hyperparameters are thus typically set before model training begins and are not modified within the training process in the way that parameters are. Hyperparameter tuning involves running trials within the training task, assessing how well they are getting the job done, and then adjusting as needed. This process generates multiple models, each trained using different families of hyperparameters.

- [Tune hyperparameters for your model with Azure Machine Learning](/azure/machine-learning/how-to-tune-hyperparameters)

#### Model selection

The process of training and hyperparameter tuning produces numerous candidate models. These can have many different variances, including the effort needed to prepare the data, the flexibility of the model, the amount of processing time, and of course the degree of accuracy of its results. Choosing the best trained model for your needs and constraints is called *model selection*, but this is as much about preplanning before training as it is about choosing the one that works best.

#### Automated machine learning (AutoML)

*Automated machine learning*, also known as AutoML, is the process of automating the time-consuming, iterative tasks of machine learning model development. It can significantly reduce the time it takes to get production-ready ML models. Automated ML can assist with model selection, hyperparameter tuning, model training, and other tasks, without requiring extensive programming or domain knowledge.

- [What is automated machine learning?](/azure/machine-learning/concept-automated-ml)

### Scoring

*Scoring* is also called *prediction* and is the process of generating values based on a trained machine learning model, given some new input data. The values, or scores, that are created can represent predictions of future values, but they might also represent a likely category or outcome. The scoring process can generate many different types of values:

- A list of recommended items and a similarity score

- Numeric values, for time series models and regression models

- A probability value, indicating the likelihood that a new input belongs to some existing category

- The name of a category or cluster to which a new item is most similar

- A predicted class or outcome, for classification models

***Batch scoring*** is when data is collected during some fixed period of time and
then processed in a batch. This might include generating business reports or analyzing customer loyalty.

***Real-time scoring*** is exactly that-scoring that is ongoing and performed as
quickly as possible. The classic example is credit card fraud detection, but real-time scoring can also be used in speech recognition, medical diagnoses, market analyses, and many other applications.
