# Individual contributor tasks in the Team Data Science Process

This article outlines the tasks that an *individual contributor* completes to set up a project in the [Team Data Science Process](overview.yml) (TDSP). The individual contributor works in a collaborative team environment that standardizes on the TDSP. The TDSP helps improve collaboration and team learning. For more information, see [Team Data Science Process roles and tasks](roles-tasks.md).

## Major roles of the individual contributor

-  **Technical management**:
    -   Manage the technical aspects of the project, including data collection, processing, analysis, modeling, and deployment.
    -   Use specialized skills in areas like machine learning, statistics, programming, and data engineering.

-  **Collaboration and communication**:
    -   Collaborate with other team members, sharing insights and knowledge.
    -   Communicate technical details and progress to the project lead and the rest of the team.
-  **Problem solving**:
    -   Address and solve technical challenges within your area of expertise.
    -   Continuously adapt and apply innovative solutions to complex data problems.
-  **Quality assurance**:
    -   Ensure the quality and integrity of your work, from data handling to model development.
    -   Adhere to best practices and standards in data science and programming.
-  **Learning and development**:
    -   Continuously learn and stay updated with the latest trends and techniques in data science.
    -   Contribute to the team's knowledge base by sharing new findings and insights.
-  **Documentation**:
    -   Document your work thoroughly, including data preparation, analysis steps, model development, and results.

## Key tasks for the individual contributor

-   **Process and analyze data**: Perform data cleaning, preprocessing, and exploratory data analysis.

-   **Develop models**: Build, train, and evaluate predictive models or algorithms.
-   **Code and develop**: Write and maintain the code necessary for data analysis and model development.
-   **Experiment and test**: Conduct experiments and tests to validate models and analyses.
-   **Create reports and visualizations**: Create reports and visualizations to communicate findings and results.
-   **Collaborate and review with others**: Participate in peer reviews and collaborative sessions to improve project quality.
-   **Provide feedback**: Provide feedback on project processes and adapt to changes in project requirements or direction.
-   **Comply with ethical standards**: Ensure compliance with ethical guidelines and data privacy standards.

## Use language models and copilots

In the context of the TDSP, project individual contributors, such as data scientists, analysts, and engineers play a hands-on role in managing various aspects of data science projects. The individual contributor can integrate language models and copilots to align with the TDSP framework in the following areas:

- **Develop and manage technical tasks**

   -   *Coding assistance*: Use copilots for coding support, including writing, reviewing, and optimizing code for data processing, analysis, and model development.

   -   *Algorithm selection and optimization*: Use language models to explore and select appropriate algorithms, and get suggestions for optimizing model performance.

- **Analyze and manage data**

  -   *Data exploration and visualization*: Use language models to get insights on effective data exploration techniques and creating meaningful visualizations.

  -   *Data cleaning and preprocessing*: Employ copilots to automate routine data cleaning and preprocessing tasks, ensuring data quality and consistency.

- **Build and evaluate models**

  -   *Model development guidance*: Use language models for guidance on building and refining predictive models, including feature engineering and hyperparameter tuning.

  -   *Model evaluation and interpretation*: Use language models to understand and apply appropriate model evaluation metrics and interpret the results.

- **Problem solve and innovate**

  -   *Technical problem solving*: Use language models for brainstorming solutions to technical challenges encountered during the project.

  -   *Innovative approaches*: Use language models to stay updated on the latest data science techniques and tools, applying innovative approaches to the project.

- **Document and report**

  -   *Documentation automation*: Employ copilots to help generating and maintaining thorough documentation of the work, including data dictionaries, model descriptions, and analysis summaries.

  -   *Reporting insights and findings*: Use language models to create clear and comprehensive reports or presentations of analytical findings for both technical and nontechnical audiences.

- **Collaborate and learn**

  -   *Collaborative workflows*: Use copilots to streamline collaboration with other team members, including sharing code, results, and insights.

  -   *Continuous learning*: Utilize language models to access the latest research, tutorials, and resources for continuous skill development and staying current in the field.

- **Comply with ethical standards**

  -   *Compliance checks*: Employ language models to ensure adherence to data privacy, ethical standards, and organizational policies in data handling and analysis.

Project Individual Contributors in TDSP can effectively use language models and Microsoft copilots for these tasks: technical execution, data analysis, model building, problem-solving, documentation, collaboration, and compliance. These tools can enhance their productivity, improve the quality of their work, and foster continuous learning and innovation in data science projects.

## Summary

Project Individual Contributors in TDSP are responsible for the execution of specific tasks and deliverables within a data science project. They bring technical expertise to the table and play a crucial role in the practical aspects of data handling, analysis, modeling, and communication of results. Their contribution is vital to the project's success, requiring a blend of technical skills, collaboration, and continuous learning.
