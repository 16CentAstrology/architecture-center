# Project lead tasks in the Team Data Science Process

This article describes tasks that a *project lead* completes setting up a repository for their project team in the [Team Data Science Process](overview.yml) (TDSP). The TDSP is a framework developed by Microsoft that provides a structured sequence of activities to efficiently execute cloud-based, predictive analytics solutions. The TDSP is designed to help improve collaboration and team learning. For an outline of the personnel roles and associated tasks, see [Team Data Science Process roles and tasks](roles-tasks.md).

A project lead manages the daily activities of individual data scientists on a specific data science project in the TDSP. 

## Major Roles of the Project Lead:

1.  **Project Planning and Execution:**
    -   Develop and execute detailed project plans, including defining project scope, timelines, milestones, and deliverables.
    -   Coordinate and oversee all project activities, ensuring adherence to the project plan.
2.  **Team Coordination and Management:**
    -   Direct and coordinate the work of individual contributors within the project team.
    -   Assign tasks, monitor progress, and ensure efficient collaboration among team members.
3.  **Technical Oversight:**
    -   Provide technical oversight and guidance on data science methodologies, tools, and techniques used in the project.
    -   Ensure that the technical approach aligns with project objectives and TDSP best practices.
4.  **Stakeholder Communication:**
    -   Serve as the primary point of contact for the project with stakeholders.
    -   Communicate project status, progress, and any issues or changes to stakeholders regularly.
5.  **Problem-Solving and Decision Making:**
    -   Lead problem-solving efforts, addressing technical challenges and adjusting the project plan as needed.
    -   Make key decisions affecting the project's direction and outcomes.
6.  **Quality Assurance:**
    -   Ensure the quality and accuracy of project deliverables.
    -   Implement quality control processes throughout the project lifecycle.
7.  **Risk Management:**
    -   Identify potential risks to the project and develop strategies to mitigate them.
    -   Manage and address issues as they arise, minimizing impact on the project.

## Key Tasks for the Project Lead:

-   **Detailed Project Scheduling:**
    -   Create and maintain a detailed schedule of project activities and deadlines.
-   **Resource Allocation:**
    -   Allocate resources (human, technical, data) effectively to meet project needs.
-   **Technical Review and Guidance:**
    -   Conduct technical reviews and provide guidance to team members on data processing, analysis, and modeling.
-   **Monitoring and Reporting:**
    -   Monitor project progress against goals and objectives.
    -   Regularly report on project status to the team, stakeholders, and management.
-   **Documentation:**
    -   Ensure comprehensive documentation of methodologies, analyses, and results.
-   **Facilitating Meetings:**
    -   Organize and lead project meetings, reviews, and brainstorming sessions.
-   **Training and Support:**
    -   Provide training and support to team members as needed.
-   **Compliance and Ethical Standards:**
    -   Ensure adherence to ethical standards, data privacy regulations, and organizational policies.
   
## Using Large Language Models and Microsoft Copilots

In Microsoft's Team Data Science Process (TDSP), the "Project Lead" is pivotal in driving individual data science projects towards their goals. Here's how a Project Lead can use Large Language Models (LLMs) and Microsoft copilots within the TDSP framework:

### Detailed Project Management:

-   **Project Planning and Scheduling:** Use LLMs to help creating detailed project plans, timelines, and scheduling, considering various project phases and milestones.
-   **Task Delegation and Monitoring:** Employ copilots to assign tasks to team members and monitor progress, ensuring adherence to the project timeline.

### Technical Oversight and Decision Making:

-   **Technical Research and Validation:** Use LLMs for researching and validating technical approaches, algorithms, and methodologies suitable for the project.
-   **Decision Support:** Use LLMs to analyze various technical options and provide data-driven recommendations for critical project decisions.

### Team Coordination and Support:

-   **Team Communication:** Utilize LLMs for drafting clear and concise communication to keep the team aligned and informed about project objectives and updates.
-   **Resource Management:** Employ copilots to track and manage the allocation and utilization of resources effectively within the project.

### Quality Control and Assurance:

-   **Code and Model Review:** Use LLMs for automated code and model reviews, ensuring adherence to best practices and identifying potential issues or improvements.
-   **Documentation Review and Enhancement:** Use LLMs to help reviewing and refining project documentation, including technical reports and user guides.

### Stakeholder Communication and Reporting:

-   **Progress Reporting:** Utilize LLMs to generate comprehensive progress reports and presentations for stakeholders, clearly communicating the status, challenges, and achievements of the project.
-   **Stakeholder Meeting Preparation:** Employ copilots to prepare for stakeholder meetings, including agenda setting, creating presentations, and summarizing key discussion points.

### Risk Management and Issue Resolution:

-   **Risk Analysis:** Use LLMs to identify potential risks and develop mitigation strategies, ensuring the smooth progress of the project.
-   **Problem-Solving Assistance:** Utilize copilots and LLMs for brainstorming and developing solutions to address project challenges or bottlenecks.

### Continuous Improvement and Learning:

-   **Feedback Analysis:** Use LLMs to analyze feedback from team members and stakeholders, identifying areas for improvement in the project.
-   **Process Optimization:** Employ copilots to refine project workflows, enhance efficiency, and implement best practices.

The Project Lead in TDSP can effectively use LLMs and Microsoft copilots for these tasks: detailed project management, technical oversight, team coordination, quality control, stakeholder communication, risk management, and continuous improvement. These tools can significantly contribute to the project's success by enhancing decision-making, efficiency, and overall project execution.

## Summary

In summary, the Project Lead in TDSP is responsible for the detailed planning, execution, and management of specific data science projects. They play a key role in coordinating team efforts, providing technical guidance, managing stakeholder communication, and ensuring the quality and success of project outcomes.
