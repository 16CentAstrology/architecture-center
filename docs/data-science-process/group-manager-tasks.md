# Team Data Science Process group manager tasks

This article describes the tasks that a *group manager* completes for a data science organization. The group manager manages the entire data science unit in an enterprise. A data science unit might have several teams, each of which is working on many data science projects in distinct business verticals. The group manager's objective is to establish a collaborative group environment that standardizes on the [Team Data Science Process](overview.yml) (TDSP). For an outline of all the personnel roles and associated tasks handled by a data science team standardizing on the TDSP, see [Team Data Science Process roles and tasks](roles-tasks.md). Group managers can delegate their tasks to surrogates, but the tasks associated with the role don't change.

## Major roles of the group manager

1. **Strategic oversight:**
    - Establish and oversee the strategic direction for the data science projects within the group.
    - Ensure alignment of projects with broader business goals and objectives.
1. **Resource management:**
    - Allocate resources, including personnel, budget, and technology, effectively across projects.
    - Balance resource allocation to meet project needs and maximize efficiency.
1. **Team building and development:**
    - Build and maintain a skilled and effective data science team.
    - Foster professional development and continuous learning within the team.
1. **Project portfolio management:**
    - Oversee the portfolio of data science projects, ensuring a healthy mix of innovation, research, and application development.
    - Monitor the progress and outcomes of projects, intervening when necessary.
1. **Risk management:**
    - Identify and mitigate risks across projects, including technical, operational, and business risks.
    - Implement strategies to manage uncertainties and ensure project success.
1. **Stakeholder communication:**
    - Communicate effectively with stakeholders at various levels, including executive leadership, to report progress, results, and challenges.
    - Act as a liaison between the data science team and other business units.
1. **Quality assurance:**
    - Uphold standards of quality in methodologies, outputs, and documentation.
    - Ensure adherence to best practices and ethical guidelines in data science work.
1. **Innovation and best practices:**
    - Encourage innovation and the adoption of emerging technologies and methodologies.
    - Share best practices and knowledge across teams and projects.

## Key tasks for the group manager

-   **Developing and reviewing project plans:**
    -   Review and approve project plans, ensuring they're viable, well-structured, and aligned with business objectives.

    -   Evaluate the performance of the team, providing feedback and identifying areas for improvement.
-   **Managing stakeholder expectations:**
    -   Manage expectations of stakeholders, negotiate priorities, and communicate the value and limitations of data science projects.
-   **Ensuring compliance and ethical standards:**
    -   Ensure that all projects comply with legal, ethical, and company standards, particularly regarding data usage and privacy.

## Use language models and copilots

In the context of Microsoft's Team Data Science Process (TDSP), the "group manager" can effectively utilize language models and copilots to enhance various aspects of managing data science teams and projects. Here's how the Group Manager can integrate these tools within the TDSP framework:

### Strategic planning and decision making

- **Market analysis and trend identification:** Use language models to analyze market trends, extract insights from large volumes of industry reports, and stay updated on the latest advancements in data science and technology.
- **Strategic Decision Support:** Use language models to provide comprehensive overviews or summaries of complex strategic options, aiding in informed decision-making.

### Resource and portfolio management

- **Resource Optimization:** Employ copilots for helping optimizing resource allocation plans, forecasting project needs, and identifying potential skill gaps in teams.
- **Project Portfolio Analysis:** Utilize language models to analyze and evaluate the performance of various projects within the portfolio, identifying areas for improvement or strategic realignment.

### Team development and leadership

- **Leadership Communication:** Use language models to draft clear and effective communications for internal stakeholders, ensuring alignment and clarity in strategic messages.
- **Training and Development:** Use language models to curate or create customized training materials and resources for team skill development.

### Risk management and quality assurance

-   **Risk Assessment:** Use language models to identify potential risks in projects by analyzing historical data and similar project outcomes, and suggest mitigation strategies.
-   **Quality Standards Enforcement:** Employ language models to help develop and maintain quality standards and best practices documentation, ensuring consistency across projects.

### Stakeholder Engagement and Reporting

-   **Stakeholder Reports:** Utilize language models to generate comprehensive and understandable reports for stakeholders, summarizing project progress, challenges, and successes.
-   **Meeting Preparation:** Use language models for preparing meeting agendas, key talking points, and presentations to effectively communicate with stakeholders.

### Innovation and Best Practices

-   **Research and Innovation Insights:** Use language models to stay abreast of cutting-edge research, new methodologies, and tools in data science. It helps translate these advances into actionable insights for the team.
-   **Best Practices Compilation:** Utilize language models to compile and update a repository of best practices, lessons learned, and case studies from completed projects.

### Collaboration and Workflow Enhancement

-   **Workflow Optimization:** Employ copilots and language models to streamline managerial workflows, automate routine tasks, and enhance efficiency in team management.
-   **Collaborative Tool Integration:** Use language models and copilots to integrate and optimize collaborative tools and platforms used by the team.

The group manager can use language models and copilots to enhance strategic planning, resource management, team development, risk management, stakeholder communication. The position should foster innovation in line with the TDSP framework. These tools can provide valuable support in decision-making, reporting, and maintaining high standards of quality and efficiency in data science projects.

## Summary

The Group Manager in TDSP is responsible for the overall management and success of data science projects. The role focuses on strategic alignment, resource allocation, team development, risk management, and stakeholder communication. These tasks bridge the gap between data science teams and the larger business objectives of the organization.
