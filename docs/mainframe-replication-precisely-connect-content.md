Mainframe and midrange systems constitute critical data and could be migrated to Azure platform with different migration strategies. Data migration plays a key role when moving data from mainframe/midrange to Azure platform. In hybrid cloud strategy, customers require data to be replicated between mainframe/midrange and Azure data platform. To maintain the integrity of the data, customers need real time replication for business-critical applications. Precisely Connect can help customers to replicate data in real time using change data capture (CDC) and through batch from mainframe/midrange data sources to Azure data platform.

Precisely Connect supports different mainframe/midrange data sources (e.g., Db2 z/OS, Db2 LUW, Db2 for i, IMS, VSAM, files, copybooks) and migrate them to Azure (e.g., SQL DB, Azure PostgreSQL, Azure MySQL, Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 (ADLS), Synapse) without impacting the applications. It also supports scalability based on the data volume and customer requirements. It replicates the data without affecting the performance and straining the network.
