## Introduction
How do we operate a backend to enable Autonomous Vehicles at scale? 
Autonomous Vehicles operations (AVOps) usually require a huge amount of storage and compute to
- Capture and process data and scenes from test vehicles (as learning material for perception model required by vehicles to drive autonomously) 
- Train perception model to recognize the environment as base functionality to drive autonomously 
- Perform safety validation based on open and closed loop simulations

## Industry Perspective
From an industry perspective, the development of autonomous driving typically involves three key stages: data collection and curation, algorithm development and simulation, model building and validation, and deployment. AVOps addresses an automated driving development lifecycle.

- ***Data Ingestion & Curation*** - Collecting and refining the *interesting* data sets for ADAS/AV Development
- ***Iteratively Test, Train & Simulate*** - Simulating and training ADAS/AV models across many *Ground Truth* scenarios
- ***Build & Validate*** - In-Vehicle software Verification & Validation (V&V) with connected vehicles

## Architecture Building Blocks

The AVOps Reference Architecture consists of four main building blocks.  The upcoming chapters shall describe the four main building blocks in detail:

- ***DataOps*** - Data ingestion of measurements (videos / images, lidar and radar), data curation and extraction, and labeling of data
- ***MLOps*** - Train algorithms such as perception models and post-perception models
- ***ValOps*** - To validate AD functions based on trained models and raw ground truth data
- ***AVOps centralized functions*** - Provide overarching functionalities like Meta-Data Search, Data Catalog, Overall orchestration, platform governance, and standardized infrastructure templates.

## Challenges

- Data collection: collecting and analyzing large amounts of data to identify patterns and improve the vehicle's performance over time.  Most of costs for vehicle development are due to data management and testing.
- Data management: handling the large amounts of data generated by the vehicle's sensors and systems while determining what data is useful.
- Scenario coverage: ensuring the OEM has tested the vehicle in a wide range of scenarios, including different weather conditions, lighting, and road conditions.
- Complexity: managing the large and diverse set of algorithms and systems required for autonomous operation.
- Verification and validation: thoroughly testing the software to ensure it behaves as expected in a wide range of scenarios and environments.
- Data availability:  globally dispersed teams and third parties make sharing of data a challenge.

AVOps allows organizations to take advantage of the scalability, flexibility, and cost-effectiveness of cloud-based infrastructure, while also speeding up the time-to-market for Automated Vehicles.

## Next Step
The reference architecture contains guidance about these logical building blocks and processes for AVOps, technology recommendations, partner, or open-source solutions for specific areas like simulation and data models.
