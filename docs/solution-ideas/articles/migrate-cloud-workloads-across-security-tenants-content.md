Modern cloud workloads use cloud native security standards and policy driven governance to establish standardization across all environments and maximize the TCO by reducing non-standard operations management.  To meet business transformation like acquisition or divesture the organizational      team including developers, architects, operations, and Technical Business Decision (TDM)s must strategize the separation or joining       of their cloud workloads from existing to a new security (AAD (Azure Active Directory)) tenant     . This ensures all data and application services relying on IaaS or PaaS cloud components are migrated, secured, and isolated to their respective business boundaries.  The built-in subscription move capability allows you to move the entire subscription under new AAD tenant, however in practice most divesture organization workloads are mixed with the retaining organization workloads before the split and the complete isolation requires surgical workload migrations.
