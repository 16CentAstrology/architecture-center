name: Multi-layer protection for accessing an Azure Virtual Machine
summary: Apply the defense-in-depth strategy by challenging users with multiple lines of defense, before the user is able to access the VM. The goal is to construct enough assurance that the user is legitimate, the intentions are legal, and the communication is secure to access a VM in Azure, only when needed.
