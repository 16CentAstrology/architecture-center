# Oracle on Azure architecture design

Microsoft and Oracle have partnered to enable customers to deploy Oracle applications in the cloud. You can run your Oracle Database and enterprise applications on Oracle Linux, Windows Server, and other supported operating systems in Azure. In addition to Oracle databases, Azure also supports WebLogic Server integrated with Azure services, applications on Oracle Linux and WebLogic Server, options for high availability and for disaster recovery, and options for backing up Oracle workloads. The interoperability of Microsoft and Oracleâ€™s cloud services enables you to migrate and run mission-critical enterprise workloads across Microsoft Azure and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI). 

Azure provides a wide range of services to support Oracle on Azure. Following are some of the key services: 

- [Accelerate your cloud adoption with Microsoft and Oracle](https://azure.microsoft.com/solutions/oracle/). Run your Oracle Database and enterprise applications on Azure and Oracle Cloud.

- [Java on Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/resources/developers/java/). Run Java EE applications with Oracle WebLogic Server on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) with solutions validated by Microsoft and Oracle.

- [Linux virtual machines in Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/virtual-machines/linux/#overview). Use preconfigured solutions from Oracle and host Java application servers with Oracle WebLogic on Azure virtual machines (VMs).

- [Oracle VM images and their deployment on Microsoft Azure](/azure/virtual-machines/workloads/oracle/oracle-vm-solutions). This article provides information about Oracle solutions based on virtual machine images published by Oracle in the Azure Marketplace.

- [Oracle application solutions integrating Microsoft Azure and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure](/azure/virtual-machines/workloads/oracle/oracle-oci-overview) | Microsoft and Oracle provide low-latency, high-throughput, cross-cloud connectivity between Azure and OCI, allowing you to partition a multi-tier application across both cloud services.


## Introduction to Oracle on Azure

If you're new to Azure, the best place to start learning about Azure is with Microsoft Learn. Microsoft Learn is a free, online training platform that provides interactive learning for Microsoft products and more.

If you have an SAP workload that depends on an Oracle database, the Learn modules in the following table can help you understand what Azure has to offer for Oracle databases and SAP.

- [Explore Azure for SAP databases](/learn/modules/explore-azure-databases). This module explores SAP databases on Azure and best practices for Azure for SAP workloads, including recommendations from Oracle.

- [Implement high availability for SAP workloads in Azure](/learn/modules/implement-high-availability-for-sap-workloads-azure). This module explores high availability and disaster recovery support of Azure for SAP workloads, including use of Oracle Data Guard for high availability of Oracle databases that support SAP workloads.

- [Perform backups and restores for SAP workloads on Azure](/learn/modules/perform-backups-restores). This module explores backup and restoration of Azure VMs and examines the steps and considerations in backing up and restoring SAP workloads on Azure, including the Oracle databases that support them.

## Path to production

The following sections can help you on the path to production for Oracle on Azure:

- [Database migration and deployment](#database-migration-and-deployment)
- [Backup and recovery of databases and workloads](#backup-and-recovery-of-databases-and-workloads)
- [WebLogic Server](#weblogic-server)

### Oracle database migration and deployment

The following articles describe how to run an Oracle database on Azure and connect to an Oracle database that's running in on OCI.

- [Run Oracle databases on Azure](./reference-architecture-for-oracle-database-on-azure.yml). This solution idea illustrates a canonical architecture to achieve high availability for your Oracle Database Enterprise Edition in Azure. High availability for your front-end and middle tier can be obtained by using Azure Load Balancers or Application Gateways. <!-- short, simple article -->

- [Oracle database migration to Azure](./reference-architecture-for-oracle-database-migration-to-azure.yml). This solution idea describes how to migrate an Oracle database to Azure by using Oracle Active Data Guard and Azure Load Balancer. This enables you to split your traffic between on-premises and Azure, allowing you to gradually migrate your application tier. The database migration is performed in multiple steps. You can migrate your entire Oracle database from on-premises to Azure VM with minimal downtime by using Oracle Recovery Manager (RMAN) and Oracle Data Guard.

- [Oracle Database with Azure NetApp Files](../../example-scenario/file-storage/oracle-azure-netapp-files.yml). This example scenario describes a high-bandwidth, low-latency solution for Oracle Database workloads.

- [Oracle database migration: Cross-cloud connectivity](../../example-scenario/oracle-migrate/oracle-migration-cross-cloud.yml). This example scenario describes creation of an interconnection between Azure and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) by using Azure ExpressRoute and FastConnect. The connection between the services allows applications hosted on Azure to communicate with Oracle database hosted on OCI.

- [Oracle database migration: Lift and shift](../../example-scenario/oracle-migrate/oracle-migration-lift-shift.yml). If you're properly licensed to use Oracle software, you're allowed to migrate Oracle databases to Azure Virtual Machines (VMs). <!-- short, simple article -->

- [Design and implement an Oracle database in Azure](/azure/virtual-machines/workloads/oracle/oracle-design). This article describes how to size an Oracle workload to run in Azure and decide on the best architecture solution for optimal performance.

- [Host a Murex MX.3 workload on Azure](../../example-scenario/finance/murex-mx3-azure.yml). This example workload provides details to implement and run Murex MX.3 workloads on various databases, including Oracle databases.

### Backup and recovery of Oracle databases and workloads

The articles in this section describe methods of backing up and recovering Oracle databases by using Azure resources.

- [Oracle Database in Azure Linux VM backup strategies](/azure/virtual-machines/workloads/oracle/oracle-database-backup-strategies). This article describes strategies for backing up Oracle databases that run on Azure.

- [Back up and recover an Oracle Database on an Azure Linux VM using Azure Files](/azure/virtual-machines/workloads/oracle/oracle-database-backup-azure-storage). This article demonstrates backing up an Oracle database that's running on a VM by using Oracle RMAN and Azure Files.

- [Back up and recover an Oracle Database on an Azure Linux VM using Azure Backup](/azure/virtual-machines/workloads/oracle/oracle-database-backup-azure-backup).
