This article presents a solution for automating the process of using AI to analyze data from various sources. For example, you can use the solution for social media text analysis. Core components in the solution are Azure Functions, Azure Cognitive Services, and Azure Database for PostgreSQL.

## Architecture

### Dataflow

1. Azure Functions is triggered as part of an Azure Data Factory pipeline. A Functions *activity* uses a linked service connection to run a function in the Data Factory pipeline.
1. Data comes from various sources, such as Azure Blob Storage and Azure Event Hubs. Data is uploaded to Blob Storage, while Event Hubs ingests a high volume of data. When the system receives new data, the function in the pipeline is triggered.
1. The function calls the Cognitive Services API to analyze the data. For example, for sentiment analysis, the function uses an Azure Cognitive Service for Language text analytics API.
1. The results of the analysis are returned in JSON format from the Cognitive Services API.
1. The function stores the data and results from the Cognitive Services API in Azure Database for PostgreSQL.
1. Azure Machine Learning studio is used to further analyze the data. Custom machine learning algorithms provide other insights into the data. Results from this analysis are stored in Azure Database for PostgreSQL.
   - If you're approaching the machine learning step with a no-code perspective, you can implement further text analytics operations on the data, like feature hashing, Word2Vector, and n-gram extraction.
   - If you prefer a code-first approach, you can run an open-source natural language processing (NLP) model as an experiment in Machine Learning studio.
1. The PostgreSQL connector for Power BI makes it possible to explore human-interpretable insights in Power BI or a custom web application.

### Components

- [Azure App Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/app-service) provides a fully managed platform for quickly building, deploying, and scaling web apps and APIs.
- [Functions](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/functions) is an event-driven serverless compute platform. For information about how to use an activity to run a function as part of a Data Factory pipeline, see [Azure Function activity in Azure Data Factory](/azure/data-factory/control-flow-azure-function-activity).
- [Event Hubs](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/event-hubs) is a fully managed big data streaming platform.
- [Cognitive Services](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/cognitive-services) provides a suite of AI services and APIs that you can use to build cognitive intelligence into apps.
- [Azure Database for PostgreSQL](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/postgresql) is a fully managed relational database service. It provides [high availability](https://www.azure.cn/support/sla/postgresql), elastic scaling, patching, and other management capabilities for PostgreSQL.
- [Machine Learning studio](/azure/machine-learning/overview-what-is-machine-learning-studio) is a cloud service that you can use to train, deploy, and automate machine learning models. The studio supports code-first and no-code approaches.
- [Power BI](https://powerbi.microsoft.com) is a collection of software services and apps that display analytics information and help you derive insights from data.

## Scenario details

The automated pipelines in this solution use state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms to analyze data from disparate sources. The analysis uses:

- AI capabilities that Cognitive Services offers, such as question answering, sentiment analysis, and text translation.
- Services that Machine Learning studio offers for managing predictive analytics.

To store data and results, the solution uses Azure Database for PostgreSQL. The PostgreSQL database supports unstructured data, parallel queries, and declarative partitioning. This support makes Azure Database for PostgreSQL an effective choice for highly data-intensive AI and machine learning tasks.

The solution also automates the delivery of results from the analysis. A connector links Azure Database for PostgreSQL with visualization tools like Power BI. These tools display insights from the data in meaningful ways.

For automation, this architecture uses Functions. This serverless solution offers many benefits:

- Infrastructure maintenance. As an Azure managed service, Functions provides the cloud environment and resources that keep apps running. Instead of managing infrastructure requirements, developers can focus on innovative work that delivers value to the business.
- Scalability. Functions provides compute resources on demand, so function instances scale as needed. As requests fall, resources and application instances drop off automatically.

### Potential use cases

Azure Database for PostgreSQL is a cloud-based solution. As a result, this solution isn't recommended for mobile applications. It's more appropriate for downstream analysis in the following industries and others:

- Transportation: Maintenance prediction
- Finance: Risk assessment and fraud detection
- E-commerce: Customer churn prediction and recommendation engines
- Telecommunications: Performance optimization
- Utilities: Outage prevention

## Considerations

These considerations implement the pillars of the Azure Well-Architected Framework, which is a set of guiding tenets that can be used to improve the quality of a workload. For more information, see [Microsoft Azure Well-Architected Framework](/azure/architecture/framework).

- For most features, the Cognitive Service for Language API has a maximum size of 5120 characters for a single document. For all features, the maximum request size is 1 MB. For data and rate limits, see [Service limits for Azure Cognitive Service for Language](/azure/cognitive-services/language-service/concepts/data-limits#maximum-characters-per-document).

- In Azure Database for PostgreSQL, your ingress volume and velocity determine your selection of service and deployment mode. Two services are available:
  - Azure Database for PostgreSQL
  - Azure Cosmos DB for PostgreSQL, which was formerly known as Hyperscale (Citus) mode

  If you mine large workloads of customer opinions and reviews, use Azure Cosmos DB for PostgreSQL. Within Azure Database for PostgreSQL, two modes are available: single server and flexible server. To understand when to use each deployment mode, see [What is Azure Database for PostgreSQL?](/training/modules/intro-to-postgres/2-what-is-azure-database-postgresql).

- Previous versions of this solution used the Cognitive Services Text Analytics API. Azure Cognitive Service for Language now unifies three individual language services in Cognitive Services: Text Analytics, QnA Maker, and Language Understanding (LUIS). You can easily migrate from the Text Analytics API to the Cognitive Service for Language API. For instructions, see [Migrate to the latest version of Azure Cognitive Service for Language](/azure/cognitive-services/language-service/concepts/migrate-language-service-latest).

### Security

Security provides assurances against deliberate attacks and the abuse of your valuable data and systems. For more information, see [Overview of the security pillar](/azure/architecture/framework/security/overview).

All data in Azure Database for PostgreSQL is automatically [encrypted](/azure/postgresql/concepts-data-encryption-postgresql) and backed up. You can configure Microsoft Defender for Cloud for further mitigation of threats. For more information, see [Enable Microsoft Defender for open-source relational databases and respond to alerts](/azure/defender-for-cloud/defender-for-databases-usage).

### DevOps

You can configure GitHub Actions to connect to Azure Database for PostgreSQL database by using its connection string and setting up a workflow. For more information, see [Quickstart: Use GitHub Actions to connect to Azure PostgreSQL](/azure/postgresql/how-to-deploy-github-action).

You can also automate your machine learning lifecycle by using [Azure Pipelines](/azure/devops/pipelines/targets/azure-machine-learning). For information about how to implement an MLOps workflow and build a CI/CD pipeline for your project, see the GitHub repo [MLOps with Azure ML](https://github.com/Microsoft/MLOpsPython).

### Cost optimization

Cost optimization is about looking at ways to reduce unnecessary expenses and improve operational efficiencies. For more information, see [Overview of the cost optimization pillar](/azure/architecture/framework/cost/overview).

Cognitive Service for Language offers various pricing tiers. The number of text records that you process affects your cost. For more information, see [Cognitive Service for Language pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/cognitive-services/language-service).
