### Dataflow

- Streaming data is ingested, processed, and the results are stored by the following:
    - Apache Kafka for data ingestion
    - Apache Spark Streaming or Apache Storm for processing
    - Apache HBase, which is a NoSQL database, for the storage of analyzed results
- The data is consumed by the user in the related apps.
- The data is visualized in Power BI.
- The data used by Azure HDInsight is stored in Azure Data Lake Storage for secure and scalable processing in the cloud.

### Components
