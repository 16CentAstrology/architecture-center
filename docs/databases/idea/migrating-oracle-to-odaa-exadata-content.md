# Introduction

This article describes considerations and recommendations when doing a physical online migration of an Oracle Database from an on-premises Exadata to Oracle Database@Azure, Exadata Database Service (OD@A) using Oracle Zero Downtime Migration (ZDM). The article assumes that you have a basic understanding of Oracle Database@Azure and Oracle Zero Downtime Migration. The article builds on the scenario described in the article [Migrating Oracle database workloads to Azure](topic-migrating-oracle-to-azure.yml).

## Scenario

Consider the following scenario:

- You have deployed Oracle Database@Azure, Exadata Database Service into your Azure region of choice and configured a VM cluster with 2 database servers and 3 Storage cell nodes.
- The Oracle Database@Azure delegated subnet (OD@A Subnet) is in OD@A Vnet which is peered to the HUB VNet, the address range of the OD@A subnet is 10.42.1.0/24. For details on how to plan for OD@A IP addressing, please refer to [Plan for IP Address Space](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/database-at-azure/oaa_ip.htm).
- In HUB VNet the traffic has to traverse a third-party Network Virtual Appliance (NVA) (FortiGate, CheckPoint, Cisco or other), the NVA functions as a routing device, ensuring that Oracle Database@Azure cluster nodes are fully routable within the infrastructure. In addition to this the NVA is configured for traffic inspection so that all traffic going to and from on-premises is inspected. The IP address of the HUB NVA is 10.0.0.5.
- Hybrid connectivity is configured in HUB VNet with an Express Route connection to your on-premises network.
- On your on-premises network you have an existing Exadata implementation Exa01 and you are looking to migrate database1 from Exa01 to Oracle Database@Azure. Database1 is 2TB in size and is running on Exadata X8M-2, the database version is Oracle Database 19c, Enterprise Edition. Your on-premises IP address range is 192.168.0.0/16.
- Currently the database is RAC enabled and for disaster recovery it is replicated via Oracle Data Guard to another data center geographically distant from where the primary is located.
- You need to migrate the database to Oracle Database@Azure with the minimum amount of downtime. You have decided to use Oracle Zero-Downtime Migration tool to orchestrate the migration.

## Network connectivity

To use ZDM for migration, you need to ensure that the source and target databases can communicate with each other. An Azure Route Table will need to be created and associated to the OD@A subnet. The Azure Route Table should point to the IP address of the HUB NVA for routing to on-premises. The HUB NVA should be configured to route traffic between on-premises and the OD@A subnet.

### Route table configuration

- Create an Azure Route Table with the following configuration and associate to the OD@A subnet:
  - Address prefix: 192.168.0.0/16
  - Next hop type: Virtual appliance
  - Next hop IP address: 10.0.0.5
  - Name: \<Route table name\>

For an example of the updated network configuration, see the following diagram:

### Verify connectivity

1. Log on to an Oracle Database@Azure database node and verify that you can ssh to the on-premises database server.

## Migration activities

1. Follow the guidance found in [Preparing for a Physical Database Migration](https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/zero-downtime-migration/21.3/zdmug/preparing-for-database-migration.html#GUID-25B07C59-8143-41CB-B431-3D9225CCFDD6) to prepare for the migration.

> Note that it is assumed that there will be sufficient bandwidth between the source and target databases to support an online migration with no need to do an offline migration (restore of backup on OD@A) first.

1. Perform the steps found in [Migrating Your Database with Zero Downtime Migration](https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/zero-downtime-migration/21.3/zdmug/migrating-with-zero-downtime-migration.html#GUID-C20DB7D4-E0CE-4B50-99D0-B16C18DDD34B) to perform the migration.

> Note that application migration activities as mentioned below will most likely need to be done in parallel with the ZDM migration, for the least amount of downtime.

1. Application services migration
    - Migrate application services as planned and discussed.
    - Update the application services to point to the new database, including the connection string, TNS entries, and any other configuration that is needed.
    - Verify that the application services are working as expected.

For an example of the updated configuration including ZDM migration node, see the following diagram:

## Post-migration activities

- Configure automated backups for the Oracle Database@Azure database as described [here](https://docs.public.oneportal.content.oci.oraclecloud.com/en-us/iaas/exadatacloud/exacs/manage-databases.html#GUID-21EF9E4B-E5D3-4A52-8B1C-609FBADD2A7D).
- Configure automated Data Guard as described [here](https://docs.public.oneportal.content.oci.oraclecloud.com/en-us/iaas/exadatacloud/exacs/using-data-guard-with-exacc.html#ECSCM-GUID-603988C3-604A-4305-B20A-EA0FF79C0835). Note that this presupposes that you have a separate instance already created in another availability zone or region.
- Keep the on-premises database running as secondary Data Guard replica for a period of time to ensure that the migration was successful.

## Conclusion

The above configuration changes will enable you to migrate your database from on-premises to Oracle Database@Azure using Oracle Zero Downtime Migration. The configuration changes will ensure that the source and target databases can communicate with each other and that the migration is performed with minimal downtime.
