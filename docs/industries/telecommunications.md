## Architectures for telecommunications

The following articles provide detailed analysis of architectures created and recommended for the telecommunications industry.

|Architecture|Summary|Technology focus|
|--|--|--|
|[Anomaly detector process](../solution-ideas/articles/anomaly-detector-process.yml)|Learn about Anomaly Detector and how anomaly detection models are selected for time-series data.|Analytics|
|[Azure Arc hybrid management and deployment for Kubernetes clusters](../hybrid/arc-hybrid-kubernetes.yml)|Learn how Azure Arc extends Kubernetes cluster management and configuration across your datacenters, edge locations, and multiple cloud environments.| Hybrid/Multicloud|
|[Build a speech-to-text transcription pipeline with Azure Cognitive Services](../reference-architectures/ai/speech-ai-ingestion.yml)|Build an audio ingestion and speech-to-text transcription pipeline by using Cognitive Services. Speech recognition can be used for analyzing customer calls. |AI / Machine learning|
|[Customer churn prediction using real-time analytics](../solution-ideas/articles/customer-churn-prediction.yml) |Predict customer churn and find patterns in existing data that's associated with the predicted churn rate by using the Microsoft AI platform.|AI / Machine learning |
|[Deploy AI and machine learning at the edge](../hybrid/deploy-ai-ml-azure-stack-edge.yml)|Learn how to extend rapid machine learning inference from the cloud to on-premises and edge locations by using Azure Stack Edge. |AI / Machine learning|
|[Determine customer lifetime value and churn prediction with Azure AI services](../example-scenario/ai/customer-lifecycle-churn.yml)|Learn how to create a solution for predicting customer lifetime value and churn by using Azure Machine Learning.|AI / Machine learning|
|[Enterprise-grade conversational bot](../reference-architectures/ai/conversational-bot.yml) |Learn how to build a robust, highly secure, and actively learning chatbot by using the Microsoft Bot Framework.|AI / Machine learning|
|[Predictive maintenance with the intelligent IoT Edge](../example-scenario/predictive-maintenance/iot-predictive-maintenance.yml)|Learn how a railway company implemented predictive safety maintenance by using machine learning on the intelligent Azure IoT Edge platform.|IoT|
|[Real-time fraud detection](../example-scenario/data/fraud-detection.yml)|Analyze data in real time to detect fraudulent transactions or other anomalous activity. This solution uses Azure Event Hubs and Stream Analytics. This architecture can be used to detect fraudulent mobile-phone calls. |Security|
