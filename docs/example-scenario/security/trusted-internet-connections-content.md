Version 3.0 of the Trusted Internet Connections (TIC) takes TIC from on-premises data collection to a cloud-based approach that better supports modern applications and systems. It improves performance because you can directly access Azure applications. With TIC 2, users accessed Azure applications via a TIC 2 Managed Trusted Internet Protocol Service (MTIPS) device, which increased response time.

You can deliver TIC 3.0 compliance for your internet-facing Azure applications and services. This article provides solutions and resources to guide government organizations to TIC 3.0 compliance. It shows how to deploy the required assets and how to incorporate the solutions into existing systems.

Routing application traffic through a firewall and logging that traffic is the core functionality demonstrated in each solution. The firewall can be Azure Firewall, Azure Front Door with Web Application Firewall (WAF), Azure Application Gateway with WAF, or a third-party network virtual appliance (NVA). The firewall helps to secure the cloud perimeter and saves logs of each transaction. Independently of the firewall layer, the log collection and delivery solution requires a Log Analytics workspace, a registered application, and an event hub. The Log Analytics workspace sends logs to the event hub.  

Cloud Log Aggregation Warehouse (CLAW) is a Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) managed service. In late 2022, CISA released TALON. TALON is a CISA managed service that uses Azure native capabilities. An instance of TALON runs in each Azure region. TALON connects to event hubs that are managed by government agencies to pull agency firewall and Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) logs into CISA CLAW.

### Dataflow

1. Firewall
   - The firewall can be any layer 3 or layer 7 firewall. 
     - Azure Firewall and some third-party firewalls, also known as Network Virtual Appliances (NVAs), are layer 3 firewalls. 
     - Application Gateway with WAF and Azure Front Door with WAF are layer 7 firewalls. 
     - This article provides deployment solutions for Azure Firewall, Application Gateway with WAF, and Azure Front Door with WAF deployments.
   - The firewall enforces policies, collects metrics, and logs connection transactions between web services and the users and services that access the web services.
1. Firewall logs
   - Azure Firewall, Application Gateway with WAF, and Azure Front Door with WAF send logs to the Log Analytics workspace.
   - Third-party firewalls send logs in syslog format to the Log Analytics workspace via a syslog forwarder virtual machine.
1. Log Analytics workspace
   - The Log Analytics workspace is a repository for logs.
   - It can host a service that provides custom analysis of the network traffic data from the firewall.
1. Service principal (registered application)
1. Azure Event Hubs Standard
1. CISA TALON

### Components

- Firewall. Your architecture will use one or more of the following firewalls. (For more information, see the [Alternatives](#alternatives) section of this article.) 
  - [Azure Firewall](https://azure.microsoft.com/products/azure-firewall) is a cloud-native, intelligent network firewall security service that provides threat protection for cloud workloads that run on Azure. It's a fully stateful firewall as a service with built-in high availability and unrestricted cloud scalability. It's available in two performance tiers: Standard, and Premium. Azure Firewall Premium includes all the functionality of Azure Firewall Standard and provides other features like Transport Layer Security (TLS) inspection and an intrusion detection and prevention system (IDPS).
  - [Application Gateway](https://azure.microsoft.com/products/application-gateway/) with [WAF](/azure/web-application-firewall/overview) is a regional web traffic load balancer that enables you to manage traffic to your web applications. WAF provides enhanced centralized protection of your web applications from common exploits and vulnerabilities. 
  - [Azure Front Door](https://azure.microsoft.com/products/frontdoor/) with [WAF](/azure/web-application-firewall/overview) is a global web traffic load balancer that enables you to manage traffic to your web applications. It provides content delivery network (CDN) capabilities to speed up and modernize your applications. WAF provides enhanced centralized protection of your web applications from common exploits and vulnerabilities. 
  - A third-party firewall is an NVA that runs on an Azure virtual machine and uses firewall services from non-Microsoft vendors. Microsoft supports a large ecosystem of third-party vendors that provide firewall services. 
- Logging and authentication.
  - Log Analytics is a tool that's available in the Azure portal that you can use to edit and run log queries against Azure Monitor Logs. For more information, see [Overview of Log Analytics in Azure Monitor](/azure/azure-monitor/logs/log-analytics-overview).
  - [Azure Monitor](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/monitor) is a comprehensive solution for collecting, analyzing, and acting on telemetry.
  - [Azure AD](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/active-directory) provides identity services, single sign-on, and multifactor authentication across Azure workloads.
  - A [service principal](/azure/active-directory/develop/app-objects-and-service-principals) (registered application) is an entity that defines the access policy and permissions for a user or application in an Azure AD tenant.
  - [Event Hubs Standard](https://azure.microsoft.com/products/event-hubs) is a modern big data streaming platform and event ingestion service.
  - CISA TALON is a CISA-operated service that runs on Azure. TALON connects to your Event Hubs service, authenticates by using a CISA-supplied certificate that's associated with your service principal, and collects logs for CLAW consumption.

### Alternatives

There are a few alternatives that you can use in these solutions:

- You can separate log collection into areas of responsibility. For example, you can send Azure AD logs to a Log Analytics workspace that's managed by the identity team, and send network logs to a different Log Analytics workspace that's managed by the network team.
- The examples in this article each use a single firewall, but some organizational requirements or architectures require two or more. For example, an architecture can include an Azure Firewall instance and an Application Gateway instance with WAF. Logs for each firewall must be collected and made available for CISA TALON to collect.
- If your environment requires internet egress from Azure-based virtual machines, you can use a layer 3 solution like Azure Firewall or a third-party firewall to monitor and log the outbound traffic.

## Considerations

These considerations implement the pillars of the Azure Well-Architected Framework, which is a set of guiding tenets that you can use to improve the quality of a workload. For more information, see [Microsoft Azure Well-Architected Framework](/azure/architecture/framework).

- Evaluate your current architecture to determine which of the solutions presented here provides the best approach to TIC 3.0 compliance.
- Contact your CISA representative to request access to CLAW.
- Use the **Deploy to Azure** buttons in this article to deploy one or more of the solutions in a test environment. Doing so should help you become familiar with the process and the deployed resources.
- See [TIC 3.0 compliance for internet-facing applications](https://github.com/Azure/trusted-internet-connection), a complimentary article that provides more  details and assets for TIC 3.0:
  - Additional information about achieving compliance.
  - ARM templates to simplify deployment.
  - Information to assist with integrating existing resources into the solution.
  - The types of logs collected for each service layer and Kusto queries for reviewing logs collected by CISA. You can use the queries for your organization's security requirements.

### Operational excellence

Operational excellence covers the operations processes that deploy an application and keep it running in production. For more information, see [Overview of the operational excellence pillar](/azure/architecture/framework/devops/overview).

- [Azure Monitor alerts](/azure/azure-monitor/alerts/alerts-overview) are built into the solutions to notify you when an upload fails to deliver logs to CLAW. You need to determine the severity of the alerts and how to respond.
- You can use ARM templates to speed up the deployment of TIC 3.0 architectures for new applications.

### Performance efficiency

Performance efficiency is the ability of your workload to scale to meet the demands placed on it by users in an efficient manner. For more information, see [Performance efficiency pillar overview](/azure/architecture/framework/scalability/overview).

- [Azure Firewall](/azure/firewall/firewall-performance), [Application Gateway](/azure/application-gateway/application-gateway-faq#performance), [Azure Front Door](/azure/frontdoor/scenarios#performance-efficiency), and [Event Hubs](/azure/architecture/serverless/event-hubs-functions/performance-scale) performance scales as usage increases.
- Azure Firewall Premium allows more TCP connections than Standard and provides increased bandwidth.
- Application Gateway v2 automatically ensures that new instances are spread across fault domains and update domains. 
- Azure Front Door provides caching, compression, traffic acceleration, and TLS termination to improve performance.
- Event Hubs Standard and Premium provide auto-inflate to scale up as load increases.

### Reliability

Reliability ensures your application can meet the commitments you make to your customers. For more information, see [Overview of the reliability pillar](/azure/architecture/framework/resiliency/overview).

- Azure Firewall Standard and Premium integrate with availability zones to increase availability.
- Application Gateway v2 supports autoscaling and availability zones to increase reliability.
- Multi-region implementations that include load balancing services like Azure Front Door can improve reliability and resiliency.
- Event Hubs Standard and Premium provide Geo-disaster recovery pairing that enables a namespace to fail over to a secondary region.

### Security

Security provides assurances against deliberate attacks and the abuse of your valuable data and systems. For more information, see [Overview of the security pillar](/azure/architecture/framework/security/overview).

- When you register an enterprise application, a service principal is created. Use a naming scheme for sevice principals that indicates the purpose of each one.
- Perform audits to determine the activity of service principals and the status of service principal owners.
- Azure Firewall has standard policies. WAFs associated with Application Gateway and Azure Front Door have managed rule sets to help secure your web service. Start with these rule sets and build organizational policies over time based on industry requirements, best practices, and government regulations.
- Event Hubs access is authorized via Azure AD managed identities with a CISA-provided certificate.

## Deploy an Azure Firewall solution

The following solution uses Azure Firewall to manage the traffic entering your Azure application environment. The solution includes all resources for generating, collecting, and delivering logs to CLAW. It also includes an app service to track the types of telemetry collected by the firewall.

:::image type="content" source="media/trusted-internet-connections-azure-firewall.png" alt-text="Diagram that shows a TIC 3.0 compliance architecture. Azure Firewall uploads logs to CLAW." border="false" lightbox="media/trusted-internet-connections-azure-firewall.png":::

 The solution includes:

- A virtual network that has separate subnets for the firewall and servers.
- A Log Analytics workspace.
- Azure Firewall with a network policy for internet access.
- Azure Firewall diagnostic settings that send logs to the Log Analytics workspace.
- A route table that's associated with the application resource group to route the app service to the firewall for the logs it generates.
- A registered application.
- An event hub.
- An alert rule that sends an email if a job fails.

For the sake of simplicity, all resources are deployed to a single subscription and virtual network. You can deploy the resources in any combination of resource groups or across multiple virtual networks.

[![Deploy to Azure](media/trusted-internet-connections-deploy-to-azure.svg)](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FAzure%2Ftrusted-internet-connection%2Fmain%2FArchitecture%2FAzure-Firewall%2FComplete%2Fazuredeploy.json)

[![Deploy to Azure Government](media/trusted-internet-connections-deploy-azure-government.png)](https://portal.azure.us/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FAzure%2Ftrusted-internet-connection%2Fmain%2FArchitecture%2FAzure-Firewall%2FComplete%2Fazuredeploy.json)

### Post-deployment tasks 

After deployment, your environment performs the firewall capabilities and logging connections. To meet compliance with TIC 3.0 policies for network telemetry collection, you need to ensure that the logs make it to CISA CLAW. The post-deployment steps finish the tasks to enable compliance. To complete these steps, you need to coordinate with CISA because CISA needs to supply a certificate to associate with your service principal. For step-by-step details, see [Post-deployment tasks](https://github.com/Azure/trusted-internet-connection/tree/main/Architecture/Post-Deployment-Tasks).

You need to complete the following tasks after deployment. You need to perform these tasks manually. You can't complete them by using an ARM template.

- Obtain a public key certificate from CISA. 
- Create a service principal (application registration).
- Add the public key certificate to the appliction registration.
- Assign the application the Azure Event Hubs Data Receiver role at the Event Hubs namespace scope.
- Activate the feed by sending the Azure tenant ID, application (client) ID, event hub namespace name, event hub name, and consumer group name to CISA.

## Deploy a solution that uses Application Gateway with WAF

The following solution uses Application Gateway with WAF to manage the traffic entering your Azure application environment. The solution includes all resources for generating, collecting, and delivering logs to CLAW. It also includes an app service to track the types of telemetry collected by the firewall.

### Post-deployment tasks  

After deployment, your environment performs the firewall capabilities and logging connections. To meet compliance with TIC 3.0 policies for network telemetry collection, you need to ensure that the logs make it to CISA CLAW. The post-deployment steps finish the tasks to enable compliance. To complete these steps, you need to coordinate with CISA because CISA needs to supply a certificate to associate with your service principal. For step-by-step details, see [Post-deployment tasks](https://github.com/Azure/trusted-internet-connection/tree/main/Architecture/Post-Deployment-Tasks).

You need to complete the following tasks after deployment. You need to perform these tasks manually. You can't complete them by using an ARM template.

- Obtain a public key certificate from CISA. 
- Create a service principal (application registration).
- Add the public key certificate to the appliction registration.
- Assign the application the Azure Event Hubs Data Receiver role at the Event Hubs namespace scope.
- Activate the feed by sending the Azure tenant ID, application (client) ID, event hub namespace name, event hub name, and consumer group name to CISA.

## Deploy an Azure Front Door with WAF solution

The following solution integrates an Azure Front Door with Web Application Firewall (WAF) to manage the traffic into your Azure application environment. The solution includes all resources to generate, collect, and deliver logs to the CLAW. It also includes an app service to highlight the types of telemetry collected by the firewall.

:::image type="content" source="media/trusted-internet-connections-architecture-front-door.png" alt-text="Diagram of T I C 3 point 0 compliance architecture with Azure Front Door with Web Application Firewall uploading logs to CLAW." border="false" lightbox="media/trusted-internet-connections-architecture-front-door.png":::

 The solution includes:

### Post-deployment tasks  

Up to now your environment is performing the firewall capabilities and logging connections. To be TIC 3.0 compliant for Network Telemetry collection, those logs must make it to CISA CLAW. The post-deployment steps finish the tasks towards compliance. These steps require coordination with CISA because you need a certificate from CISA to associate with your Service Principal. For step-by-step details, see [Post Deployment Tasks](https://github.com/Azure/trusted-internet-connection/tree/main/Architecture/Post-Deployment-Tasks).

The following tasks must be performed after deployment is complete. They're manual tasks—an ARM template can't do them.

- Obtain a public key certificate from CISA. 
- Create a Service Principal (App Registration).
- Add the CISA-provided certificate to the App Registration.
- Assign the application with the Azure Event Hubs Data Receiver role to the Event Hubs Namespace.
- Activate Feed by sharing Azure Tenant ID, Application (client) ID, Event Hubs Namespace name, Event Hubs name, and Consumer group name with your CISA POC

## Third-party Firewall (also known as Network Virtual Application)

> [!NOTE]
> This solution does not have a Deploy to Azure capability and is meant for guidance only.

The following solution defines how a Third-party firewall can be used to manage the traffic into your Azure application environment and support TIC 3.0 compliance. Third-party firewalls require use of a Syslog forwarder virtual machine with its agents registered with the Log Analytics workspace. The Third-party firewall is configured to export its logs in syslog format to the Syslog forwarder virtual machine and the agent is configured to send its logs to the Log Analytics workspace. Once the logs are in the Log Analytics workspace, they're sent to the Event Hubs and processed like the other solutions outlined in this article.

:::image type="content" source="media/trusted-internet-connections-architecture-nva.png" alt-text="Diagram of T I C 3 point 0 compliance architecture with Third-party Firewall uploading logs to CLAW." border="false" lightbox="media/trusted-internet-connections-architecture-nva.png":::

### Post-deployment tasks  

Up to now your environment is performing the firewall capabilities and logging connections. To be TIC 3.0 compliant for Network Telemetry collection, those logs must make it to CISA CLAW. The post-deployment steps finish the tasks towards compliance. These steps require coordination with CISA because you need a certificate from CISA to associate with your Service Principal.
