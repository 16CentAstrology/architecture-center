# Oracle database migration - Cross-cloud Connectivity

![](media/cross-cloud-connectivity.png)

To support multi-cloud experience, Microsoft and Oracle provide direct interconnection between Azure and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) through ExpressRoute and FastConnect. It allows applications hosted on Azure and Oracle database hosted on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) with low latency, high throughput by connecting an ExpressRoute circuit in Microsoft Azure with a FastConnect circuit in OCI.

#### Certify applications

For which Oracle applications are certified by Oracle and supported direct interconnection, refer [those certified applications by Oracle](/azure/virtual-machines/workloads/oracle/configure-azure-oci-networking) to run in Azure.

#### How to configure cross-cloud connectivity
Refer [Set up a direct interconnection between Azure and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure](/azure/virtual-machines/workloads/oracle/configure-azure-oci-networking) to gain step-by-step configurations.
