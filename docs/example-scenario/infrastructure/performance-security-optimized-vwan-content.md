This architecture is from a global manufacturing company. Their Operational technology and Information Technology departments are highly integrated demanding a single internal network. However, these environments have drastically different security and performance requirements. Due to the sensitive nature of their operations they require all traffic to be firewall protects and have an IDPS solution in place. Their Information Technology department has less demanding security requirements for the network but would like to performance optimize so users have low latency access to their IT applications. 

They turned to Azure VWAN to meet their global needs for a single network with varying security and performance requirements to get an easy to manage, deploy and scale solution so that as they add regions they can continue to grow seamlessly with a highly optimized network for their needs.
