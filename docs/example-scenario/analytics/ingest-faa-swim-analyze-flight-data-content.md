This solution shows you how to integrate Chef Infra, Chef InSpec, Test Kitchen, Terraform, Terraform Cloud, and GitHub Actions in order to fully automate and create Data Analytics environments. It uses a Databricks cluster in order to analyze the data.

It uses Federal Aviation Administrationâ€™s (FAA's) System Wide Information System (SWIM) and connects to TFMS (Traffic Flow Management System) using a Kafka server. More information about SWIM and TFMS can be found [here]. 

Depending on what kind of information you want to analyze, you need to subscribe to a different data source from SWIM.
