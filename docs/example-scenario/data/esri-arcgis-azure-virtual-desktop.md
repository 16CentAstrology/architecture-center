Esri’s technology is a Geographic Information System (GIS) that contains many important capabilities around visualization, analysis, data management, etc. of geospatial data. Esri’s core technology is called the ArcGIS platform which includes capabilities around mapping, spatial analysis, 3D GIS, imagery & remote sensing, data collection and management, and field operations. See here for more information. A key part of the technology includes a desktop software app called ArcGIS Pro which is a 64-bit professional desktop GIS.  It allows GIS Analysts to perform spatial analysis and edit spatial data while also allowing GIS administrators to create and publish geospatial services. In this architecture, we will show how ArcGIS Pro can be deployed in Azure Virtual Desktop for the purpose of supporting enterprise customers at the hyperscale of Azure. The architecture also includes backend components such as ArcGIS Enterprise so as to build a complete system in Azure.
