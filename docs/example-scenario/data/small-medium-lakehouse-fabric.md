This example workload illustrates a greenfield solution to build a robust, scalable data platform using the lakehouse design paradigm on Microsoft Fabric. Microsoft Fabric, a cutting-edge platform that seamlessly integrates data storage, processing, and analytics. Unlike traditional data warehouses, which often involve complex migrations and costly transformations, a greenfield lakehouse provides a clean slate for designing an efficient, future-proof data ecosystem.

## Who may benefit from this architecure

The greenfield data lakehouse architecture with Microsoft Fabric is beneficial for a wide range of scenarios including:

- Organisations looking to start fresh, unencumbered by legacy systems, when developing a data platfrom.
- Have an expected data volume between 0.5 to 1.5 TB.
- Looking for a simple and streamlined pattern that balances cost, complexity, and performance considerations.
