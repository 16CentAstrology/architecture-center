This article briefly describes the steps for running Autodesk Civil 3D on a virtual machine (VM) that's deployed on Azure. It also presents the performance results of running Civil 3D on Azure. 

Civil 3D is a 3D model-based design solver that civil engineers can use for design automation and production, enabling multidisciplinary team coordination. Civil 3D: 

## Architecture

<Architecture diagram goes here.>

*Download a [Visio file](https://arch-center.azureedge.net/DiagramName.vsdx) of this architecture.*

- If the diagram has Visio or PowerPoint source uploaded to the CDN, include the download link.
- A numbered or bulleted list describing the architecture usually follows the diagram.
- However, the Architecture Guide template doesn't require a section named Architecture, nor a bulleted or numbered list.

The Architecture Guide template requires the following sections at the end of the article:
  
## Contributors

> (Expected, but this section is optional if all the contributors would prefer to not include it)

> Start with the explanation text (same for every article), in italics. This makes it clear that Microsoft takes responsibility for the article (not the one contributor). Then include the "Pricipal authors" list and the "Additional contributors" list (if there are additional contributors). Link each contributor's name to the person's LinkedIn profile. After the name, place a pipe symbol ("|") with spaces, and then enter the person's title. We don't include the person's company, MVP status, or links to additional profiles (to minimize edits/updates). (The profiles can be linked to from the person's LinkedIn page, and we hope to automate that on the platform in the future). 
> Implement this format:

*This article is maintained by Microsoft. It was originally written by the following contributors.*

**Principal authors:** > Only the primary authors. List them alphabetically, by last name. Use this format: Fname Lname. If the article gets rewritten, keep the original authors and add in the new one(s).

 * [Author 1 Name](http://linkedin.com/ProfileURL) | (Title, such as "Cloud Solution Architect")
 * [Author 2 Name](http://linkedin.com/ProfileURL) | (Title, such as "Cloud Solution Architect")
 * > Continue for each primary author (even if there are 10 of them).

**Other contributors:** > Include contributing (but not primary) authors, major editors (not minor edits), and technical reviewers. List them alphabetically, by last name. Use this format: Fname Lname. It's okay to add in newer contributors.

 * [Contributor 1 Name](http://linkedin.com/ProfileURL) | (Title, such as "Cloud Solution Architect")
 * [Contributor 2 Name](http://linkedin.com/ProfileURL) | (Title, such as "Cloud Solution Architect")

## Next steps

- Bulleted list of third-party and other Docs and Microsoft links.
- Links shouldn't include en-us locale unless they don't work without it.
- Docs links should be site-relative, for example (/azure/feature/article-name).
- Don't include trailing slash in any links.

## Related resources

- Use "Related resources" for architecture information that's relevant to the current article. It must be content that the Azure Architecture Center TOC refers to, but may be from a repo other than the AAC repo.
- Links to articles in the AAC repo should be repo-relative, for example (../../solution-ideas/articles/article-name.yml).
