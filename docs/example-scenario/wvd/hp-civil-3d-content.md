This article briefly describes the steps for running [Autodesk Civil 3D](https://www.autodesk.com/products/civil-3d/overview?term=1-YEAR&tab=subscription&plc=CIV3D) on a virtual machine (VM) that's deployed on Azure. It also presents the performance results of running Civil 3D on Azure.

Civil 3D is a 3D model-based design solver that civil engineers can use for design automation and production, enabling multidisciplinary team coordination. Civil 3D:
- Includes purpose-built tools for critical civil engineering disciplines.
- Integrates automation and analysis with support for building information modeling throughout a project lifecycle.  
- Connects project teams (when used with Collaboration for Civil 3D and BIM Collaborate Pro). 
- Enables effective visualization and analysis of geospatial/geotechnical data from ArcGIS.

Civil 3D was originally designed as an AutoCAD add-on. Civil 3D extensions now incorporate grading optimization, rail switch, and crossing enhancements.  

Civil 3D is used primarily to plan, design, and deliver land development, water, and transportation projects, including roads and highways, rail, bridges and tunnels, site development, and storm and sanitary networks. One of the main use cases is grading optimization.

## Why deploy Civil 3D on Azure?  

- Modern and diverse compute options to align to your workload's needs 
- The flexibility of virtualization without the need to buy and maintain physical hardware 
- Rapid provisioning 
- Strong GPU acceleration, with increased performance as GPUs are added
