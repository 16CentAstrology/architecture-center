# Field and Cloud Edge Gateways
While devices can connect to the IoT Platform directly, they can also be
connected to **Edge Gateways** to implement intelligent capabilities
outside the application. This enables functionality such as aggregation,
or filtering, of device events before being sent to the IoT Platform,
localized decision-making, and [protocol and identity
translation](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/iot-edge/iot-edge-as-gateway)
on-behalf-of devices.
