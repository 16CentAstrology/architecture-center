# Wind farms, energy storage, power generation monitoring and optimization

A global integrated energy company, Contoso has capabilities across the energy and utilities value chain. Contoso also owns different assets like solar, wind farms and energy storage. 

## Motivations

-   *What are the business challenges?*

-   *What is the estimated impact caused by these issues?*

There have been some anomalies in the data regarding the output generated by Contoso’s wind turbines. Such issues will only surface much later because the results are sent for the application in batches at specific intervals.

In addition, Contoso is unable to accurately forecast energy demand and supply, which makes it difficult to decide when to generate power for the grid instead of using renewable power from their wind farms and solar farms. 


## Current situation

-   *What are the current operation methods?*

Currently, in order to understand how each wind turbine is operating in relation to the others, field engineers would access the relevant operational data in the control center. As the telemetry data is sent in batches, the information for analysis is a day late.

As the current forecasting application makes a “best estimate” of the wind farms’ rate of generation, results are often not very accurate. Without real-time data to form accurate energy production forecasts, Contoso is unable to achieve the business and operational agility it needs to succeed in the volatile energy trading market.


## Business Outcomes

-   *What business outcomes would you like to achieve?*

-   *What opportunities would this solution create for your business?*

Ideally, Contoso wants the ability to view its operating conditions remotely to reduce the effort and resources spent on commissioning and troubleshooting issues with the wind turbines. This will also decrease the unplanned downtime as they are able to send field engineers on-site for maintenance with the real time condition data. 

As a solution, the application should provide accurate production forecasts to improve Contoso’s operational efficiencies and help optimize its energy generation plan. Application features should include providing real-time visibility of how much power is produced by the wind turbine on a certain day and how much power generators are needed to be adjusted for demand-supply balance in the grid.


## Solution to the challenges

-   *How can technology like Internet of Things (IoT) help solve your business challenges?*

Contoso wants to apply an IoT solution to enable the real-time monitoring and optimization of their integrated energy business.

The table below provides a summary of common use cases and the corresponding IoT solution. Each use case is an example of how an IoT process pattern can be applied in real-world scenarios. For more details on IoT process patterns, please refer to the detailed [documentation](./measure-and-control-loop.md).
