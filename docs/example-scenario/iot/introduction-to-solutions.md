# Introduction to IoT Solutions

Connected sensors, devices, and intelligent operations can transform
businesses and enable new growth opportunities with Microsoft Azure
Internet of Things (IoT) services. 

## Overview of IoT Solutions

Azure **IoT Solutions** can be described
as **Devices**, sending **Events** that are used to
generate **Insights**, which are used to generate **Actions** to help
improve a business or process.

Fundamentally, IoT Solutions rely on a relationship between Events,
Insights, and Actions to connect diverse populations and types of
"things" to cloud applications to achieve end-to-end scenarios. 
 

> Note: The terms "Thing" and "Device" are often used to in describing
IoT applications. Conceptually, these are interchangeable terminology as
both represent a contract of a "connected thing" in an IoT Solution.

## Content Summary

The intent of this content is to help build familiarity with concepts
and patterns that can be applied to building Internet of Things
Applications. The approach intends to:  

1.  **Introduce**: Introduce concepts with a concise and human-readable overview. 

2.  **Illustrate**: Provide examples of concepts using generalized scenarios to illustrate. 

3.  **Demonstrate**: Provide links to reference material that can apply a concept. 


This approach is motivated by a desire to fill gaps we
historically observed in approaches to designing solutions around Azure
IoT. More so, we hope to better arm our customers with concepts,
patterns, and reference material that aids in deciding the best way to
apply an IoT Platform to their ends.
