# Introduction to IoT Solutions

Connected sensors, devices, and intelligent operations can transform
businesses and enable new growth opportunities with Microsoft Azure
Internet of Things (IoT) services. 

## Overview of IoT Solutions

Azure **IoT Solutions** can be described
as **Devices**, sending **Events** that are used to
generate **Insights**, which are used to generate **Actions** to help
improve a business or process.

Fundamentally, IoT solutions rely on a relationship between Events,
Insights, and Actions to connect diverse populations and types of
"things" to cloud applications to achieve end-to-end scenarios. 
 

> Note: The terms "Thing" and "Device" are often used to describe
IoT applications. Conceptually, these are interchangeable terminology as
both represent a contract of a "connected thing" in an IoT Solution.

## Content Summary

The intent of this content is to complement existing [Azure IoT documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/iot-fundamentals) with concepts and patterns to consider when approaching development of an IoT solution. This may serve as a good primer to Azure IoT Solutions, with an approach designed to:

1.  **Introduce**: Introduce concepts with a concise and human-readable overview. 

2.  **Illustrate**: Provide examples of concepts using generalized scenarios to illustrate. 

3.  **Demonstrate**: Provide links to reference material that can apply a concept. 


This aims to arm readers with a human-readable series of concepts and patterns that will help in approaching the design and development of IoT solutions.
