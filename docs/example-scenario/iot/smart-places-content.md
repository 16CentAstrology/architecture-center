*Smart places* are physical environments that bring together connected devices and data sources. By using these environments, you can see and control:

- Products and systems
- Interior and exterior spaces
- Personal experiences with surroundings

Smart places can include buildings, college or corporate campuses, stadiums, and cities. They provide value by:

- Helping property owners, facility managers, and occupants operate and maintain spaces
- Making spaces more efficient, cost effective, comfortable, and productive

These environments work by digitally modeling the spaces and compiling relevant data. From that data, you can derive insights on how people, places, and devices are connected.

- Azure Maps

- Azure Graph and check diagram for others

- Dynamics 365

- Teams apps

#### Support components

Or maybe call them shared services.

- [Azure Monitor](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/monitor/) can collect, analyze, visualize, and send notifications from the operational telemetry across the services.

- [Azure Defender for IoT](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/defender-for-iot/overview) is a unified security service that works across Azure services to protect the solution.

- [Azure DevOps](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/devops/) is a set of services to manage the code, project, deployments that you need for a well-run development team. 

- [Azure Active Directory](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/active-directory/) is the core of Microsoft identity and security services, and is critical to integration with other cloud services, ISV solutions and on premises solutions.

- [Azure Key Vault](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/key-vault/) provides a safe store for keys and secrets across the full solution.

### Alternatives

-   [Azure
    CosmosDB](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/cosmos-db/) is
    another option that offers a fully managed NoSQL database service.
    It scales easily, and offers different interaction styles, including
    document database, graph database, SQL style query, Cassandra API
    and more. It also includes [a link for access from Azure
    Synapse](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cosmos-db/synapse-link),
    so all of these data services can be used in conjunction if
    requirements demand it.

-   [Azure Event
    Hubs](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/iot-hub/iot-hub-compare-event-hubs)
    are also a viable ingestion service. Event Hubs differ from IoT Hub
    in that they facilitate one-way traffic, so they are great for
    ingestion but don't provide command and control communication.
    Event Hubs scale well and have strong security. Event Hubs differ
    from IoT Hub in that they do not offer device-level security, so
    are more appropriate when the solution has a high volume of
    messages from a low number of input devices.

## Considerations

The following considerations apply to this solution:

### Scalability considerations
Smart Places solutions range from relatively simple, low volume to sophisticated solutions with very high data volume (such as a solution that aggregates HVAC telemetry across a large campus.)   The core Azure services in this architecture are built to scale, but when they are integrated with one another to form a solution, the development team needs to ensure that they do not create unintentional choke points.  Avoiding these choke points is best addressed by having performance tests run at scheduled intervals to identify potential problems early in the development cycle.

### Flexibility considerations
Integration is mentioned in the article, but Smart Places solutions need to pay additional attention to building a solution that remains flexible.   Smart Places use cases are rapidly evolving, so new sensors, new data types, new Artificial Intelligence opportunities, and new visualization techniques will inevitably be required after initial deployment. The proposed architecture is loosely coupled which is a requirement for flexibility, the use of [industry standards for data ontology](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/digital-twins/concepts-ontologies-adopt), will reduce the time to add new functionality and integrate new software, and the use of [Azure API Management](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/api-management/#overview) increases flexibility by providing a way to create multiple API styles and signatures to a single underlying API.

### Security considerations
Legacy building solutions often relied on a lack of external connectivity as the primary source of security.  In today‚Äôs world, even data that doesn‚Äôt identify people can still be used to draw conclusions about the business or the people in the building.   It is also common to use cameras to achieve use cases such as people counting, asset tracking, and security.  In these cases, be clear with specifics about where the images are processed, what gets saved and where, and ensure that the customer requirements for both privacy and use case are addressed. The bottom line on security for Smart Places solutions is that for all data, security must be top of mind throughout the data lifecycle.  Think about what is being collected, where it is being processed, where it will be stored, and what conclusions can be drawn from the collective set of data.

## Pricing
The [Azure pricing calculator](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/calculator/) can be used to estimate costs for an IoT solution. Other considerations are described in the Cost section in [Microsoft Azure Well-Architected Framework](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/architecture/framework/cost/overview).

The [Azure IoT Reference Architecture](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/architecture/reference-architectures/iot/) also has a discussion about how to optimize cost for several services commonly used in IoT solutions.
