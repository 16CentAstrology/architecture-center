*Smart places* are physical environments that bring together connected devices and data sources. By using these environments, you can see and control:

- Products and systems
- Interior and exterior spaces
- Personal experiences with surroundings

Smart places can include buildings, college or corporate campuses, stadiums, and cities. They provide value by:

- Helping property owners, facility managers, and occupants operate and maintain spaces
- Making spaces more efficient, cost effective, comfortable, and productive

These environments work by digitally modeling the spaces and compiling relevant data. From that data, you can derive insights on how people, places, and devices are connected.

Add info as specified in template:

- A paragraph that describes what the solution does
- A paragraph that contains a brief description of the main Azure services that make up the solution.

## Business outcomes

In this example solution, a large commercial real estate owner is
digitally transforming its office property. This improvement combines
legacy facilities-management data with new features and technologies including:

- Occupancy sensing
- Caf√© queue optimization
- Parking
- Shuttle services

This effort requires integrating *brownfield*, or legacy, devices and modern IoT devices that monitor the physical space. The brownfield devices communicate through common building transports such as BACnet and Modbus.

The company's goals include:

- Optimizing energy usage by diagnosing faults and streamlining field service management. This optimization integrates the existing building management system with devices.

- Deriving new spatial insights and offering innovative occupant experiences by connecting modern devices.

- Developing a cohesive digital model of the environment by bringing together multiple sources of data. The model should expand data analysis opportunities.

- Creating a scalable solution that can collect and archive millions of data points.

- Building a solution that can easily add partner solutions. The solution should also incorporate partner data into the environment's digital twin.

## Potential use cases

This solution applies to many areas:

- Smart campuses
- Facilities management
- Smart offices
- Energy optimization

- B2B connector translate & stream data bidirectionally between vendor devices/solutions and Azure Digital Twins. With a growing ecosystem of vendors using industry standard ontologies with Digital Twins Definition Language [(DTDL)](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/digital-twins/concepts-models) such as [RealEstateCore](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/internet-of-things/realestatecore-a-smart-building-ontology-for-digital-twins-is/ba-p/1914794), these integrations will become simpler over time.

- [Azure Digital Twins](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/digital-twins/overview) holds the spatial graph of the buildings and environment (rephrase). The environment is modeled with [Digital Twins Definition Language](https://github.com/Azure/opendigitaltwins-dtdl/blob/master/DTDL/v2/dtdlv2.md) (DTDL). Azure Digital Twins has a [REST API](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/iothub/service/digitaltwin), currently the only way to ingest data. This documentation also includes SDK references for supported languages for control and data plane operations.  When using IoT Hub or Event Hub, there must be a service that pulls the data from the source and calls the [API to submit to Azure Digital Twins](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/digital-twins/how-to-ingest-iot-hub-data). The [ontology](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/digital-twins/concepts-ontologies) can be built from the ground up with DTDL, or start with industry supported models such as [RealEstateCore](https://github.com/azure/opendigitaltwins-building), [Smart Cities Ontology](https://github.com/Azure/opendigitaltwins-smartcities), or the [Energy Grid Ontology](https://github.com/Azure/opendigitaltwins-energygrid/).

- [Azure Functions](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/digital-twins/how-to-create-azure-function?tabs=cli) processes the data, such as comparing it to other sensor data for fault detection, roll up information to related instances in the graph, etc. (eliminate redundancy with diagram step).

- [Azure Data Explorer](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/data-explorer/data-explorer-overview).

- Azure Cognitive Services. functionality that happens either in near real-time, at certain data thresholds, by user demand, or that requires more sophisticated or longer running processing.

- AI models (check diagram for exact name) functionality that happens either in near real-time, at certain data thresholds, by user demand, or that requires more sophisticated or longer running processing.

- [Azure API Management](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/api-management/) offers services to normalize, secure, rate limit, and customize APIs (maybe remove some of that info from diagram steps).

- Service Bus queues provide a publish/subscribe mechanism for service applications that need to exchange data asynchronously and/or at volume.

- Event Hubs provide a publish/subscribe mechanism for service applications that need to exchange data asynchronously and/or at volume.

- [SignalR](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/digital-twins/how-to-integrate-azure-signalr) updates UIs as telemetry and data changes (rephrase).

- Azure Digital Twins Explorer creates the DTDL model. Currently in public preview.

- Model Uploader is responsible for loading the model into Azure Digital Twins.

- Power Apps

- Power BI

- Azure Maps

- Azure Graph and check diagram for others

- Dynamics 365

- Teams apps

- [Azure Monitor](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/monitor/) can collect, analyze, visualize, and send notifications from the operational telemetry across the services.

- [Azure Defender for IoT](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/defender-for-iot/overview) is a unified security service that works across Azure services to protect the solution.

- [Azure DevOps](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/devops/) is a set of services to manage the code, project, deployments that you need for a well-run development team. 

- [Azure Active Directory](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/active-directory/) is the core of Microsoft identity and security services, and is critical to integration with other cloud services, ISV solutions and on premises solutions.

- [Azure Key Vault](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/key-vault/) provides a safe store for keys and secrets across the full solution.

### Alternatives

-   [Azure
    CosmosDB](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/cosmos-db/) is
    another option that offers a fully managed NoSQL database service.
    It scales easily, and offers different interaction styles, including
    document database, graph database, SQL style query, Cassandra API
    and more. It also includes [a link for access from Azure
    Synapse](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cosmos-db/synapse-link),
    so all of these data services can be used in conjunction if
    requirements demand it.

-   [Azure Event
    Hubs](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/iot-hub/iot-hub-compare-event-hubs)
    are also a viable ingestion service. Event Hubs differ from IoT Hub
    in that they facilitate one-way traffic, so they are great for
    ingestion but don't provide command and control communication.
    Event Hubs scale well and have strong security. Event Hubs differ
    from IoT Hub in that they do not offer device-level security, so
    are more appropriate when the solution has a high volume of
    messages from a low number of input devices.

## Considerations

The following considerations apply to this solution:

### Scalability considerations
Smart Places solutions range from relatively simple, low volume to sophisticated solutions with very high data volume (such as a solution that aggregates HVAC telemetry across a large campus.)   The core Azure services in this architecture are built to scale, but when they are integrated with one another to form a solution, the development team needs to ensure that they do not create unintentional choke points.  Avoiding these choke points is best addressed by having performance tests run at scheduled intervals to identify potential problems early in the development cycle.

### Flexibility considerations
Integration is mentioned in the article, but Smart Places solutions need to pay additional attention to building a solution that remains flexible.   Smart Places use cases are rapidly evolving, so new sensors, new data types, new Artificial Intelligence opportunities, and new visualization techniques will inevitably be required after initial deployment. The proposed architecture is loosely coupled which is a requirement for flexibility, the use of [industry standards for data ontology](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/digital-twins/concepts-ontologies-adopt), will reduce the time to add new functionality and integrate new software, and the use of [Azure API Management](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/api-management/#overview) increases flexibility by providing a way to create multiple API styles and signatures to a single underlying API.

### Security considerations
Legacy building solutions often relied on a lack of external connectivity as the primary source of security.  In today‚Äôs world, even data that doesn‚Äôt identify people can still be used to draw conclusions about the business or the people in the building.   It is also common to use cameras to achieve use cases such as people counting, asset tracking, and security.  In these cases, be clear with specifics about where the images are processed, what gets saved and where, and ensure that the customer requirements for both privacy and use case are addressed. The bottom line on security for Smart Places solutions is that for all data, security must be top of mind throughout the data lifecycle.  Think about what is being collected, where it is being processed, where it will be stored, and what conclusions can be drawn from the collective set of data.

## Pricing
The [Azure pricing calculator](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/calculator/) can be used to estimate costs for an IoT solution. Other considerations are described in the Cost section in [Microsoft Azure Well-Architected Framework](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/architecture/framework/cost/overview).

The [Azure IoT Reference Architecture](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/architecture/reference-architectures/iot/) also has a discussion about how to optimize cost for several services commonly used in IoT solutions.
