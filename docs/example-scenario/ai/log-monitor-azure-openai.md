This architecture provides comprehensive logging, monitoring, and security of the Azure OpenAI API, for use in enterprise deployments of the service. It enables advanced logging capabilities to track API usage and performance, as well as robust security measures to protect sensitive data and prevent malicious activity.

Key Solution Advantages:

- Comprehensive logging of Azure OpenAI model execution tracked to Source IP address.  Log information includes what text users are submitting to the model as well as text being received back from the model.  This ensures models are being used responsibly within the corporate environment and within the approved use cases of the service.
- High availability of the model APIs to ensure user requests are met even if the traffic exceeds the limits of a single Azure OpenAI service.
- Secure use of the service by ensuring role-based access managed via Azure Active Directory follows principle of least privilege.

### Workflow

1.	Client applications can access Azure OpenAI endpoints to perform text generation (completions) and model training (fine-tuning) endpoints to leverage the power of large language models.
2.	Application Gateway provides single point of entry to Azure OpenAI models and provides load-balancing for APIs.
  
    a.	Note: Load balancing of stateful operations such as model fine-tuning, deployments, and inference of fine-tuned models is not supported.
3.	API Management enables security controls, auditing, and monitoring of the Azure OpenAI models.  
   a.	Secure access is granted via AAD (Azure Active Directory) Groups with subscription-based access permissions in APIM (API Management).  
   b.	Auditing is enabled via Azure Monitor request logging for all interactions with the models.  
   c.	Monitoring enables detailed AOAI (Azure Open AI) model usage KPIs/Metrics including prompt information as well as token statistics for usage traceability.
4.	API Management Service connects to all Azure resources via Private Link to ensure all traffic is secured by private endpoints and contained to private network.
5.	Multiple Azure OpenAI instances enable scale out of API usage to ensure high-availability and disaster recovery for the service.

### Components

- [Azure Application Gateway](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/application-gateway/). Application load balancer to ensure all users of the Azure OpenAI APIs can achieve the fastest response and highest throughput for model completions.
- [Azure API Management](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/api-management/). API for accessing backend Azure OpenAI endpoints, provides additional monitoring and logging not available natively in Azure OpenAI service.
- [Azure Virtual Network](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/virtual-network/). Provides network isolation so all model network traffic is routed privately to the Azure OpenAI service.
- [Azure OpenAI Cognitive Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/products/cognitive-services/openai-service/). Service which hosts models and provides Generative Model completion outputs.
- [Azure Monitor](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/monitor/). Provides access to application logs through Kusto Query Language. Also enables Dashboard reports and Monitoring/Alerting capabilities.
- [Azure Key Vault](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/key-vault/). Securely stored keys and secrets for application use.
- [Azure Storage](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/storage/). Application cloud storage, provides accessibility to model training artifacts to the Azure OpenAI service.
- [Azure Active Directory](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/active-directory/)
  - Secure Identity manager on Azure, enables authentication and authorization of users to the application as well as platform services supporting the application.
  - Enable group policies to ensure principle of least privileges is granted for all users.

### Alternatives

Why do I need this solution? Doesnâ€™t the Azure OpenAI service provide logging and monitoring natively?

The short answer is yes, you can track telemetry of the service through the Azure OpenAI service, but the default cognitive service logging supplied does not track or record inputs and outputs of the service such as prompts, tokens, or models. These components are especially important for compliance purposes and to ensure the service operates as expected. Furthermore, by tracking interactions with the Large Language Models deployed to Azure OpenAI you can analyze how your organization is using the service to identify cost and usage patterns which can help inform decisions on scaling and resource allocation.

## Scenario details

For large enterprises that intend to implement Generative AI (Artificial Intelligence) Models, auditing and logging of the usage of these models is paramount to ensure responsible use and corporate compliance. This solution provides enterprise level logging and monitoring for all interactions with the AI Models to mitigate harmful usage of the models and ensure security and compliance standards are met. This solution integrates with existing APIs for Azure OpenAI with little modification to leverage existing code bases.  Additionally, administrators can monitor service usage for reporting purposes.

**Example Query for Usage Monitoring:**

```
ApiManagementGatewayLogs
| where OperationId == 'completions_create'
| extend modelkey = substring(parse_json(BackendResponseBody)['model'], 0, indexof(parse_json(BackendResponseBody)['model'], '-', 0, -1, 2))
| extend model = tostring(parse_json(BackendResponseBody)['model'])
| extend prompttokens = parse_json(parse_json(BackendResponseBody)['usage'])['prompt_tokens']
| extend completiontokens = parse_json(parse_json(BackendResponseBody)['usage'])['completion_tokens']
| extend totaltokens = parse_json(parse_json(BackendResponseBody)['usage'])['total_tokens']
| extend ip = CallerIpAddress
| summarize
    sum(todecimal(prompttokens)),
    sum(todecimal(completiontokens)),
    sum(todecimal(totaltokens)),
    avg(todecimal(totaltokens))
    by ip, model
```

Output:

**Example Query for Prompt Usage:**

```
ApiManagementGatewayLogs
| where OperationId == 'completions_create'
| extend model = tostring(parse_json(BackendResponseBody)['model'])
| extend prompttokens = parse_json(parse_json(BackendResponseBody)['usage'])['prompt_tokens']
| extend prompttext = substring(parse_json(parse_json(BackendResponseBody)['choices'])[0], 0, 100)
```

## Considerations

These considerations implement the pillars of the Azure Well-Architected Framework, which is a set of guiding tenets that can be used to improve the quality of a workload. For more information, see [Microsoft Azure Well-Architected Framework](/azure/architecture/framework).

### Reliability

Reliability ensures your application can meet the commitments you make to your customers. For more information, see [Overview of the reliability pillar](/azure/architecture/framework/resiliency/overview).

This scenario ensures high availability of the large language models for your enterprise users. The Azure Application Gateway provides an effective layer-7 application delivery mechanism to ensure fast and consistent access to applications. Azure API Management enables you to configure, manage and monitor access to your models. The platform services such as Storage, Key Vault, and Virtual Network ensure high reliability for your application with inherent high availability. Furthermore, multiple instances of the Azure OpenAI service ensure service resilience in the case of application-level failures. With these architecture components, you can ensure reliability of your application at enterprise scale.

### Security

Security provides assurances against deliberate attacks and the abuse of your valuable data and systems. For more information, see [Overview of the security pillar](/azure/architecture/framework/security/overview).

Enterprise security is of the utmost importance in the use of sensitive data for business critical workstreams. By implementing best practices for application and network level isolation of your cloud services, this scenario mitigates risks of data exfiltration and data leakage. All network traffic containing potentially sensitive data input to the model is isolated to a private network and does not traverse public internet routes. In addition, the use of express route services can be used to further isolate the network traffic to corporate intranet and ensure end-to-end network security.

### Cost optimization

Cost optimization is about looking at ways to reduce unnecessary expenses and improve operational efficiencies. For more information, see [Overview of the cost optimization pillar](/azure/architecture/framework/cost/overview).

To explore the cost of running this scenario, all of the services are pre-configured in the cost calculator. To see how the pricing would change for your particular use case, change the appropriate variables to match your expected traffic.

We have provided three sample cost profiles based on amount of traffic (For simplicity we assume a document contains approximately 1000 tokens):

- [Small](https://azure.com/e/c367a7fdf6174ddfb39563d4f835fa14) : this pricing example correlates to processing 10,000 documents a month.
- [Medium](https://azure.com/e/e0581d8d849c48f4beb1cfcf374c1f36) : this pricing example correlates to processing 100,000 documents a month.
- [Large](https://azure.com/e/b1a2c35910ea42f0bf1eed0ea44e27bf) : this pricing example correlates to processing 10m documents tokens a month.
