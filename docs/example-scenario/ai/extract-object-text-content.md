Schematic and industrial diagrams often have objects that contain text. AI Builder retrieves this information for you. A Power Automate workflow uses a trained model to extract text from an image. Azure Form Recognizer analyzes and extracts text from diagrams in the form of key-value pairs. By using this solution, your organization can index this information and easily retrieve the data.

Once you've configured a workflow, you can search documents for meaningful text that's imbedded in shapes and objects. Manually scanning an entire document for relevant text can be laborious and time consuming.

## Potential use cases

Use cases include:

- Complicated engineering schematic diagrams that contain various types of objects. By using this solution, users can quickly search for specific components on a diagram. Having access to embedded text in objects are helpful for investigations, exposing shortages, or looking for recall and failure notices.
- Industrial diagrams that show the components in a manufacturing assembly. This solution promptly identifies pumps, valves, automated switches, and other components. Identifying components help with preventative maintenance, isolating hazardous components, and increasing the visibility of risk management in your organization.

## Architecture

In this section, we explain the workflow and how each component plays a role:

1. An object detection model is trained in AI Builder to recognize objects that a user specifies.
1. A new document enters a SharePoint document library, OneDrive, or Teams.
1. The document's arrival triggers a Power Automate event. That event:
   1. Runs the AI Builder model. AI Builder returns a JSON file that contains the pixel coordinates of any specified objects.
   1. Sends the document to Form Recognizer for a full OCR scan. Form Recognizer returns a JSON file that contains scanned-in text and pixel coordinates of the text.
   1. Runs a function in Azure Functions. The function analyzes the pixel coordinates in the AI Builder and Form Recognizer output files. If detected objects intersect with scanned-in text, the function returns the matched data in a JSON file.
   1. Enters the metadata, or the text from detected objects, into a document library.
1. The metadata is captured in a SharePoint search index.
1. Users search for the metadata by using PnP Modern Search web parts.

### Components

- [AI Builder](/ai-builder/overview) is a Power Platform capability. Use AI Builder to train object detection models to recognize images that you provide.
- [Form Recognizer](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/form-recognizer) uses machine-learning models to extract and analyze form fields, text, and tables from your documents.
- [Power Automate](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/developer-tools/power-automate) is part of Power Platform's no-code or low-code intuitive solutions. Power Automate is an online workflow service that automates actions across apps and services.
- [Azure Functions](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/functions) is an event driven serverless function. Azure Functions runs on demand and at scale on the cloud.
- [PnP Modern Search](https://microsoft-search.github.io/pnp-modern-search) web parts is a set of SharePoint Online modern web parts. Use this solution to create highly flexible and personalized search-based experiences.

### Alternatives

- Azure Cognitive Services can do a full OCR scan of documents, with the resulting metadata stored in SharePoint.
- SharePoint can run OCR scans on documents and add content output to the index for retrieval. Use search techniques to target key information in documents.
- If you want to process a high rate of documents, consider using Azure Logic Apps to configure the components. Azure Logic Apps prevents you from hitting consumption limits in your tenant, and is cost-effective.  For more information, see [Azure Logic Apps](/azure/logic-apps/logic-apps-overview).

### Considerations

Consider these points when you analyze and process documents:

- AI Builder can only capture square coordinates when using a trained model. Objects with text outside their boundaries, like triangles and circles, could potentially add unwanted and unnecessary information.
- The metadata that's output from Azure Functions can contain extra characters if there's text outside the object's boundaries.
- The AI Builder creation process can tag more than one object. The resulting JSON file from the Azure Functions contains all object types and text. The application consumes the metadata and needs to parse through and process the results.

### Availability

Azure replicates data to ensure durability and high availability. Data redundancy protects you from planned and unplanned eventsâ€”including transient hardware failures, network or power outages, and natural disasters. Choose to replicate your data within the same data center, across zonal data centers within the same region, or across geographically separated regions.

### Scalability

Azure Functions is highly scalable. This platform offers multiple plans that automatically scale on demand when events are triggered. For more information, see [Event driven scaling](/azure/azure-functions/event-driven-scaling).

Azure Functions has a limit of 200 instances. If you need to scale beyond this limit, add multiple regions or app plans.

### Security

Use standard security practices for the components being used, and for the SharePoint document library that the metadata will be stored in.

Form Recognizer is designed with compliance, privacy, and security in mind.  It authenticates access using an API key, encrypts data during transit and storage, and returns results using the API key. For more information, see [Data, privacy, and security for Form Recognizer](/legal/cognitive-services/form-recognizer/fr-data-privacy-security)

AI Builder relies on environment security and Dataverse security roles and privileges to grant access to AI features in Power Apps. Privileges are set by default in Dataverse. System administrators can use the default built-in security roles without further actions. For more information, see [Security overview](/power-platform/admin/wp-security).

## Deploy this scenario

For more information on deploying this scenario, see the [Power Automate Community Blog](https://powerusers.microsoft.com/t5/Power-Automate-Community-Blog/Extract-Text-From-Objects/ba-p/1249705) and the [Extract Text From Objects](https://github.com/Spucelik/ExtractTextFromObjects) GitHub repo.

## Pricing

- For Power Automate, make sure the licenses that you've purchased and assigned are adequate for the volume of documents that you process. Include a HTTP premium connector to call the Forms Recognizer and the Azure function.
- Purchase AI Builder credits based on the expected model utilization.
- To estimate the cost of Azure products and configurations, visit the [Azure pricing calculator](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/calculator).

## Next steps

- Understand the types of documents that would be well suited for this solution. Typical documents include schematic diagrams, manufacturing control processes, and diagrams that contain many shapes that need to be isolated.  For more information, see [Power Automate](../../power-automate/power-automate.yml).
- Become familiar with the capabilities that AI Builder offer. For more information, see [AI Builder on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGtomFKVDys).
- Define an information architecture that can receive and process your metadata. For more information, see [Use in flow overview](/ai-builder/use-in-flow-overview).
- For information on how the solution works and whether it's suitable for your use cases, see [Extract text from objects](https://powerusers.microsoft.com/t5/Power-Automate-Community-Blog/Extract-Text-From-Objects/ba-p/1249705).
