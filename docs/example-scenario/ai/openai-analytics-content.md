## Workflow

1. Phone calls between an agent and a customer are recorded and stored in Azure Storage. Audio files are uploaded to a Storage account via a supported method, such as a UI-based tool like [Azure Storage Explorer](/azure/vs-azure-tools-storage-manage-with-storage-explorer) or a [storage SDK or API](/azure/storage/blobs/reference).

1. Audio files are transcribed by using [Azure Speech service](/azure/cognitive-services/speech-service/) in [batch mode](/azure/cognitive-services/speech-service/batch-transcription) asynchronously with speaker diarization enabled. The transcription results are persisted in Azure Blob Storage.

1. [Personally identifiable information detection and redaction](/azure/cognitive-services/language-service/personally-identifiable-information/how-to-call-for-conversations) is performed by using [Azure Language service](/azure/cognitive-services/language-service/) to identify, categorize, and redact sensitive information in the transcript.

   For batch mode transcription and personally identifiable information detection and redaction, use the [AI services Ingestion Client tool](/azure/cognitive-services/speech-service/ingestion-client). The Ingestion Client tool uses a no-code approach to call center transcription.

1. The transcripts are processed to extract entities, [summarize conversations](/azure/cognitive-services/openai/quickstart?tabs=command-line&pivots=programming-language-studio#try-text-summarization), and analyze sentiments by using [Azure OpenAI](/azure/cognitive-services/openai/). The processed output is stored in Blob Storage and then analyzed and visualized by using other services. You can also store the output in a datastore to keep track of metadata and for reporting needs. Use Azure OpenAI to process the information from the stored transcriptions.

1. The output is visualized by using [Power BI](/power-bi/fundamentals/power-bi-overview) or a custom web application that's hosted by [App Service](/azure/app-service/). Both options provide near real-time insights. You can store this output in a CRM, so agents have contextual information about reasons why a customer called and can quickly solve problems. This process is fully automated, which saves the agents time and effort.

## Components

- [Blob Storage](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/storage/blobs) is the object storage solution for raw files in this scenario. Blob Storage supports libraries for languages like .NET, Node.js, and Python. Applications can access files on Blob Storage via HTTP or HTTPS. Blob Storage has [hot, cool, and archive access tiers](/azure/storage/blobs/access-tiers-overview) for storing large amounts of data, which optimizes cost.

- [Azure OpenAI](/azure/ai-services/openai/overview) provides REST API access to the Azure OpenAI language models, including the GPT-3 model, the Codex model, and embeddings model series, for content generation, summarization, semantic search, and natural language-to-code translation. Users can access the service through REST APIs, Python SDK, or the web-based interface in the [Azure OpenAI Studio](https://oai.azure.com/).
