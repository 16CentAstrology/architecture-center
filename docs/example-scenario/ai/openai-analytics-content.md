## Workflow

1. [Azure OpenAI Service](/azure/cognitive-services/openai/overview) allows us to extract rich insights from customer conversation in the contact center. The first step begins with the collection of data. Calls between an agent and a customer are recorded and stored in Azure Storage. Audio files can be uploaded to an Azure Storage account via any supported method. You can use a UI-based tool like [Azure Storage Explorer](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/vs-azure-tools-storage-manage-with-storage-explorer) or use a [storage SDK or API](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/reference)

1. The workflow of transcription and analysis of a call helps in improving customer experience by providing business insights and suggesting actions to agents. Key technical components of this part of the workflow are:

2. The Aaudio files are then transcribed using [Azure Speech Service](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/speech-service/) in [batch mode](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/speech-service/batch-transcription) asynchronously with speaker diarization enabled and the transcription results are persisted inthe transcription results to the Azure Blob Storage.

3. Further, [PII detection and redaction](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/language-service/personally-identifiable-information/how-to-call-for-conversations) is done using [Azure Language Service](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/language-service/) to identify, categorize and redact sensitive information in the transcript.

For both batch mode transcription, and PII detection and redaction, the Azure Cognitive Services Ingestion client ([Ingestion Client with Azure Cognitive Services](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/speech-service/ingestion-client)) can be used.

The Ingestion Client is a tool released by Microsoft for a call center transcription with a no-code approach.

4. The transcripts are then further processed to extract entities, [summarize conversation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/openai/quickstart?tabs=command-line&pivots=programming-language-studio#try-text-summarization)s, and analyze sentiments using [Azure OpenAI Service](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/openai/). and then tThe processed output is stored in Azure Blob Storage for extensive analytics and for visualization using other services. Optionally, output can be stored in any datastoreDB of your choice to keep track of metadata and any reporting needs. Also, Azure OpenAI service can also be used to process the relevant information from the stored transcriptions.

5. Typically, agents take multiple minutes to manually write down insights from customer conversation this data, but here, it is fully automated, which saves the agents time and efforta few minutes per call. The output can be visualized using [PowerBI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/fundamentals/power-bi-overview) or a custom web application that's hosted by [App Service](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/)for near real-time insights, so operators can understand what is happening in the contact center. Furthermore, this information can be stored in a CRM, so agents have contextual informationa rich view ofn why a customer called in the past and are able to solve problems quicker.

**Components**

- [Blob Storage](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/storage/blobs) is the object storage solution for raw files in this scenario. Blob Storage supports libraries for multiple languages, such as .NET, Node.js, and Python. Applications can access files on Blob Storage via HTTP/HTTPS. Blob Storage has [hot, cool, and archive access tiers](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/access-tiers-overview) to support cost optimization for storing large amounts of data.

**Performance efficiency**

Performance efficiency is the ability of your workload to meet the demands placed on it by users in an efficient manner. For more information, see [Performance efficiency pillar overview](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/framework/scalability/overview).

Periods when this solution processes high volumes can expose performance bottlenecks. Make sure that you understand and plan for the [scaling options for](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-scale#scale)[Cognitive Services autoscaling](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/autoscale?tabs=portal)to ensure proper performance efficiency for your solution .

The batch speech API is designed for high volume, but other Cognitive Services APIs might have request limits for each subscription tier. Consider containerizing these APIs to avoid throttling large-volume processing.Containers give you flexibility in deployment, in the cloud or on-premises. You can also mitigate side effects of new version rollouts by using containers. For more information, see [Container support in Azure Cognitive Services](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/cognitive-services-container-support).
