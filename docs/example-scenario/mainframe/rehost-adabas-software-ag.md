Overview and Use Cases  

For decades, Software AG Adabas has been the adaptable database system behind many large and mission-critical business applications. Now you can bring the convenience of cloud computing to these applications without giving up your Adabas database, the Natural programming language, or even your green screen—unless you want to.  

Most organizations we work with are pragmatic in their approach to digital transformation—they want to reuse what they can and make cost-effective choices about the rest. That’s why the rehost approach to cloud migration is so popular. You simply move your workload as is, if possible, to Azure Virtual Machines (VMs), a type of infrastructure as a service (IaaS). VMs run in Azure datacenters that are managed by Microsoft, so you benefit from the efficiency, scalability, and performance of a distributed platform without the overhead of hardware management. 

However, to gain the full benefits of cloud computing, consider a refactor approach using modern techniques such as container-based microservices. This type of migration is more complex than a Rehost approach, but the payoff is maximum flexibility and scalability. 

This architecture presents the rehost option and gives you a high-level look at what’s possible whether you keep the green screen or go modern.
