### Workflow

The architecture of BMC AMI Cloud integration with Azure includes several components. Each component plays an important role in the data migration and transformation process.

1. BMC AMI Cloud Agent starts a z/OS task that sends encrypted and compressed mainframe data to Blob Storage over Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP). It helps ensure secure and efficient data transfer without the need for intermediate storage, which reduces latency and potential points of failure.

1. BMC AMI Cloud Management Server, a Docker-based web application, administers the cloud agents. It manages policies, activities, and storage. This process helps ensure seamless data management.

1. BMC AMI Cloud Analytics converts mainframe data that's stored in Blob Storage into formats that are suitable for AI, business intelligence, and machine learning applications. BMC AMI Cloud Analytics supports conversion to CSV and JSON, and enables direct integration with Azure Databases. This capability supports a wide range of analytical and operational use cases.

## Components

Each component of the BMC AMI Cloud Data is designed to optimize various aspects of the data migration and management process:

- **BMC AMI Cloud Agent** is a Java-based application that runs as a started task on one or more z/OS logical partitions (LPARs). It reads and writes data directly to and from Blob Storage over TCP/IP. The BMC AMI Cloud Agent uses the zIIP engine, which significantly reduces general CPU consumption. This optimization enhances mainframe performance and lowers cost. This optimization enhances mainframe performance and lowers costs. You can use multiple agents to increase scalability and resilience.

- **BMC AMI Cloud Management Server** is a web application that runs in a Docker container that manages the web UI and communication with z/OS agents. It provides a way to define policies for data protection, data migration, and data archival. This process helps ensure that data management aligns with organizational requirements and compliance standards. For superior availability, deploy this application on Azure Virtual Machines within your virtual network.

- **Lifecycle management engine** is a Java-based application that runs on-premises on a z/OS LPAR. It deletes expired data from object storage and z/OS. This process automates data lifecycle management and helps ensure that storage resources are used efficiently.

- **Data management command-line interface (CLI)** is a command-line interface that runs on z/OS LPARs. Users can perform backup, restore, archive, recall, and delete actions to and from Blob Storage by using the CLI. The CLI provides flexibility and control over data management tasks, and enables integration with existing workflows and scripts.

- **BMC AMI Cloud Analytics** is a Docker-based application that transforms BMC AMI Cloud-managed objects into open formats that AI, business intelligence, and machine learning applications can process. This capability allows organizations to unlock the value of their mainframe data by making it accessible to modern analytical tools.

### Networking and identity

Secure and reliable connectivity between on-premises mainframe systems and Azure cloud services is crucial for the success of any modernization effort.

- **[Azure ExpressRoute](/azure/well-architected/service-guides/azure-expressroute)** provides a private and reliable connection to Azure services. This connection delivers superior performance and enhanced security compared to public internet connections. It helps users transfer mainframe data from on-premises environments to Azure via a private connection. This service is ideal for organizations that have stringent data sovereignty requirements.

- **[Azure VPN Gateway](/azure/vpn-gateway/vpn-gateway-about-vpngateways)** sends encrypted traffic between Azure Virtual Network and on-premises locations over the public internet. You can deploy this solution for scenarios where a dedicated private connection isn't feasible to transfer the mainframe data to Azure.

- **[Microsoft Entra ID](/entra/fundamentals/whatis)** synchronizes with on-premises Active Directory for identity and access management. Microsoft Entra ID supports single sign-on and multifactor authentication, which enhances security and user experience. It helps ensure encrypted data transmission between the BMC AMI Cloud agent and Blob Storage. You can manage and administer the permissions by using role-based access control.
