Frequently the evolution and maintenance of the business applications is stalled because of the underlying legacy hardware. Possibly because the hardware is no longer compatible with newer upgrades and integrations, or worse it is no longer supported. Aging infrastructure for mission critical applications is a concern. The longer the problem remains unsolved the higher the risk and cost of mitigation will become. These applications (software) have supported the organization’s critical business and evolved over decades, gone through audits and certifications and have a well-established operation around them. So instead of a high-risk re-engineering complex project, an alternative approach could be a low-risk project to move the workload (applications) as-is to a modern and less expensive platform like Azure cloud with the help of an emulator. Such a project – often called a “Lift and Shift” - preserves the business functionality of the application and replaces only the hardware, guaranteeing business continuity.
