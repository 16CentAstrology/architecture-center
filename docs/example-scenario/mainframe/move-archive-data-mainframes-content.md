Mainframe and Midrange generate, process, and store huge amounts of data in their storage systems. Once this data gets old, there will not be much use to this data on Mainframe/Midrange systems. However, compliance and regulatory rule may mandate that this data should be stored for a certain number of years. This is where the archival of Mainframe/Midrange data plays a major role. Archival would help in cost reduction, resource optimization, and data analytics.

Archival can be done for data that are related to compliance/historic. This reference architecture shows how we can move data from Mainframe/Midrange to Azure. In this architecture, the archived data is serviced/used in Mainframe only. Azure just acts as a storage medium. Depending on various parameters such as cost, time, speed, etc., one of the methods could be chosen which can help in data archival between mainframe and Azure storage. Depending on various application parameters such as business criticality/archival frequency, one can decide the time interval between archival.
