This architecture shows how the Raincode IMSql rehosts IMS/DB (IMS Database Manager) and IMS/TM (IMS Transaction Manager) systems on .NET and SQL Server in the simplest possible setting, namely using virtual machines. Legacy applications can be recompiled to target .NET and interact with IMSql in the same manner as they would interact with IMS on the Mainframe. Raincode’s IMSql transforms Mainframe applications to an Azure-native architecture while thoroughly preserving the business logic.    

This architecture is focused on implementing an IMS Mainframe application workload to Azure using Raincode’s IMSql product. This architecture is about rehosting a Mainframe IMS workload to Azure seamlessly without translation or modification of existing application with critical IMS features and capabilities using IMSql and Azure SQL Server.
