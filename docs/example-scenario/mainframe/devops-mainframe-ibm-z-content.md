Azure DevOps can help customers develop and modernize their z/OS applications using IBM Z and Cloud Modernization stack, resulting in increased speed and agility and greater developer productivity. Customers can modify their existing COBOL, PL/I, Java, or assembler programs using any integrated development environment (IDE) of their choice. Additionally, they can leverage the benefits of new programming languages like Python, Node.js, and Go, which can be executed on z/OS. This approach allows for easy adaptation to new languages while still retaining the flexibility to work with preferred IDEs.
