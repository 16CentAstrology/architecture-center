Enterprise messaging infrastructure (EMI) is a key service for organizations. Moving from older, less secure methods of authentication and authorization to modern authentication is a critical challenge in a world where remote work is common. Implementing multifactor authentication requirements for messaging service access is one of the most effective ways to meet that challenge.

This article describes four architectures to help you enhance your security in a Outlook Access scenario by using Azure AD Multi-Factor Authentication. 

The following four scenarios are described in this article:
- Outlook Access for user's mailbox in Exchange Online
- Outlook Access option 2 (AD FS) for user's mailbox in Exchange Online
- Outlook Access for user's mailbox in Exchange On-premises
- Outlook Access option 2 (AD FS) for user's mailbox in Exchange on-premises

All four architectures cover both Outlook for Windows and Outlook for MAC.

## Potential use cases
This architecture is relevant for the following scenarios and industries:
- Enhance EMI security.
- Adopt a [Zero Trust](https://www.microsoft.com/security/business/zero-trust) security strategy.
- Apply your standard high level of protection for your on-premises messaging service during transition to or coexistence with Exchange Online.
