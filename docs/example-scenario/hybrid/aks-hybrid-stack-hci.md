This article provides recommendations for building an app deployment pipeline for containerized apps running on Azure Kubernetes Service hybrid deployment options on Azure Stack HCI/Windows Server. Specifically, the guidance is for deployments using Azure Arc and GitOps.

Kubernetes is the de facto standard orchestrator for new containerized deployments. As the number of Kubernetes cluster and environments grow, managing these individually can become a challenge. Using Azure Arc-enabled services such as Arc enabled Kubernetes, GitOps, Monitor, Policy reduces the administrative burden and helps address this challenge.
