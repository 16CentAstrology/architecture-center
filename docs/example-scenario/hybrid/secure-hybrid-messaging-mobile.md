Enterprise messaging infrastructure (EMI) is a key service for organizations. Moving from older, less secure methods of authentication and authorization to modern authentication is a critical challenge in a world where remote work is common. Implementing multi-factor authentication requirements for messaging service access is one of the most effective ways to meet that challenge.

This article describes two architectures to help you enhance your security in an Outlook mobile access scenario by using Azure AD Multi-Factor Authentication.

These scenarios are described in this article:
- Outlook mobile access when the user's mailbox in Exchange Online
- Outlook mobile access when the user's mailbox in Exchange on-premises

Both architectures cover both Outlook for iOS and Outlook for Android.
