This series of articles provides guidance on using SWIFT components on Azure. This article discusses the basic components that the architecture examples in this series use.

The intended audience for the articles is program managers, architects, and engineers who are implementing SWIFT components on Azure. This documentation is organized into the following structure:

- A high-level overview of the Azure architecture to deploy SWIFT components (this article).
- A detailed reference architecture for each of the components (links in the [Related resources] section).

## Architecture

The following diagram is a high-level Azure reference architecture of connectivity to the SWIFT network. For more information on the SWIFT components, see the [SWIFT glossary](https://developer.swift.com/glossary).
