This example workload demonstrates the automation of Fab Scheduling and Dispatching of Semiconductor manufacturing workloads on Azure. These simulations in the Azure cloud generate intelligent solutions for solving some of the most complex, dynamic, real-world challenges across many industries. To achieve this, enterprises must rely on high-performance computing (HPC) environments where these kinds of simulations can be performed at scale. This scenario is based on a minds.ai Maestroâ„¢, a semiconductor manufacturing product suite which is being used by minds.ai customers on the Microsoft Azure platform.
