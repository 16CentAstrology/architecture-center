# Conducting a Proof of Concept or Pilot
## Introduction
When driving the technical and security decision for your company or customer, conducting a Proof of Concept (PoC) or pilot is an opportunity to deliver evidence that the Microsoft solution will solve business problems. 
The likelihood of success and an adoption is higher when a PoC or pilot is conducted.

A PoC is:
- Is evidence that demonstrates that a business model or idea is feasible.
- Is a quick demonstration that the solution will work to solve the business problem.
- Usually involves one to three features or capabilities that you prove to work.
- Can be in one technology or multiple technologies.
- Is usually geared toward a particular scenario and proves what the customer needs to know to make the technical or security decision.
- Is only used as a demonstration; it will not go into production.
- Is IT-driven and enablement-driven.

A pilot is:
- A test run or trial of a proposed action or product.
- More long term than a PoC.
- A higher return on investment (ROI) than a PoC.
- Often measured in weeks or months.
- Built in a pre-production or trial environment with the intent that it will then go into production.
- Adoption-driven and consumption-driven.

Ensure that your actions are always legal and compliant. Be aware of the compliance issues when working in a customer’s environment:
- Are you allowed to touch their keyboards or screens?
- Can there be demo or alteration in their environment?
- If you do need to touch something, a contract is usually required, and a partner or Microsoft Services can be involved. Without a contract, your company will be liable.
- Verify if Legal department approval is needed when dealing with governance. Maybe your company cannot give intellectual property (IP) away for free. A legal contract or several legal contracts must be in place and your company or the customer pays for the IP.
- You need to get disclosure guidance when dealing with non-disclosure agreements (NDAs), a product roadmap, NDA features, or anything not released to the general public.
- In a pilot, do not use a trial Microsoft Developers Network (MSDN) environment, and do not use any environment that you own.

The question around licensing is what type of environment to use. When conducing a PoC or pilot:
- Use properly-licensed software.
- Ask the opportunity owner to make sure that this has been correctly handled.

Who pays for the PoC or pilot? The customer, partner, or your company pays for the PoC or pilot. Depending on the size of the contract, the ROI, and the cost of sale, one group may cover it all, or it could be a combination of all three covering the cost. It is important to ensure that your company or customer has some kind of investment in the PoC or pilot. If they do not, this can be a red flag signaling that your company or customer does not yet see value in the solution.

## PoC and pilot process
### Phase I: Preparation
Health check considerations:
- Do you have a good technical plan, including the key decision makers and Microsoft potential?
- Can you deliver the needed assurance without a PoC or switch this to a pilot?
- What are the detailed scope and decision criteria agreed to by the your team or customer?
- If you met the criteria, your company or customer will buy or deploy?
- Risk analysis.
- Evaluating the setting.
- Doing the preparation.
- Workloads and human resources.
- Presentations of PoC/pilot health status.
- Technical prerequisites.
- Go/no go decision.
- Final specification of project plan.

### Phase II: Execution
During the execution phase:
- Determine who will kick off the presentation.
- Schedule the meeting in the morning, if possible.
- Prepare the demos and slides.
- Conduct a dry run to refine the presentation.
- Get feedback.
- Involve your company or customer team.
- Complete the win/loss statement.

### Phase III: Debriefing
During the debriefing phase consider:
- If debriefing of criteria was met/not met.
- Investment of the stakeholders.
- Initiating deployment.
- Finding a partner and training.
- The lessons learned in the meeting.
- Corrections or extensions of PoC/pilot guidance.
- The archival of valuable deliverables.

### Roles and responsibilities 
Tecnhical Decision Maker (TDM) is responsible for driving the decision. If a PoC or pilot is needed, the TDM is responsible for ensuring that the right partners and resources are involved:
- Ensure that you are aware of the partners in your product and service area or region.
- Be aware of their key service offerings around your product service area.

### Change management
Change management is the practice of administering changes with the help of tested methods and techniques in order to avoid new errors and minimize the impact of changes. It is better to drive a customer to do a pilot than a PoC because:
- The customer is heavily involved in a pilot.
- There is a higher probability that the customer will implement the change.

It is ideal for a pilot to include a cross-section of users so that any potential issues or problems that arise during the pilot and can be addressed.
Often a user is comfortable and familiar with their old technology and has difficulty moving into a new technological solution. Change management keeps this in mind and helps the user understand the reasons behind this change and the impact this change will make. This understanding of the change is part of a pilot and gets addressed to everyone who has a stake in the project.
The pilot includes a detailed follow up that is achieved through surveys or focus groups. The feedback can prove and improve the change.
