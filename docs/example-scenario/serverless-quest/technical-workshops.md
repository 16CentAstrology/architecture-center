# Technical Workshops

In our [Microsoft Cloud Workshop (MCW)](https://microsoftcloudworkshop.com/) program, you can find content to host workshops that foster cloud learning and adoption. Each workshop includes presentation decks, trainer and student guides, and hands-on lab guides. Feel free to contribute your own content and feedback to add to a robust database of training guides for deploying advanced Azure workloads on the Microsoft Cloud Platform.

Below you can see workshops related to application development workload:
- [Serverless architecture](https://github.com/Microsoft/MCW-Serverless-Architecture). Implement a series of Azure Functions that independently scale and break down business logic to discrete components, allowing customers to pay only for the services they use.
- [App modernization](https://github.com/Microsoft/MCW-App-Modernization). Design a modernization plan to move services from on-premises to the cloud by leveraging cloud, web, and mobile services, secured by Azure Active Directory.
- [Modern cloud apps](https://github.com/Microsoft/MCW-Modern-Cloud-Apps). Deploy, configure, and implement an end-to-end secure and PCI compliant solution for e-commerce that is based on Azure App Services, Azure Active Directory, and Azure DevOps.
- [Cloud-native applications](https://github.com/microsoft/MCW-Cloud-native-applications). Using DevOps best practices, build a proof of concept to transform a PaaS application to a container-based application with multi-tenant web app hosting.
- [Continuous delivery in Azure DevOps](https://github.com/Microsoft/MCW-Continuous-Delivery-in-Azure-DevOps). Set up and configure continuous delivery within Azure to reduce manual errors using Azure Resource Manager templates, Azure DevOps, and Git repositories for source control.

## Next steps

To move forward with the exercise 'validate and commit the serverless adoption', see the following resources:

- [Execute an application assessment](./application-assessment.md)
- [Conduct architectural design session(s)](./ads.md)
- [Identify and execute a PoC or Pilot project](./poc-pilot.md)
- [Plan technical trainings for the project team](./technical-training.md)
- [Deliver a technical implementation with the team or customer](./code-with.md)
