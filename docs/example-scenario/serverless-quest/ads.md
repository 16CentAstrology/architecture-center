# Architectural Design Sessions
tbc too much internal information 
## Introduction

Architecture is a term applied to both the process and the outcome of thinking out and specifying:
- The overall structure.
- Logical components.
- The logical interrelationships of a computer and its operating system.
- A network or other conception.

The definition of an architecture used in ANSI/IEEE Std 1471-2000 is: “The fundamental organization of a system, embodied in its components, their relationships to each other and the environment, and the principles governing its design and evolution.“
An architectural design session (ADS) occurs when:
- An architectural design session (ADS) is necessary when you need an in-depth discussion on how a new solution will blend into the environment.
- The first step is to explain the reference architecture to the team or customer. If this satisfies all of their decision criteria, and the team or customer agrees with the reference architecture, then you can move forward without running an ADS.
- If the reference architecture does not meet their decision criteria, then you will need to conduct an ADS to custom build an architecture that works in their environment and satisfies all of their decision criteria and technical requirements.

Before you set up an ADS, you need to work with your stakeholders to identify needs and decide whether an alternative engagement would be a better fit:
- If you are looking for information on some solutions, a product briefing might be a better, faster, and lower-cost option.
- If you want to try out a product, running a demonstration or a hands-on lab might be a better environment for testing.
- If you want to improve your skills, get a training, either online or from a local partner.
- If you are interested in collaborating on a solution around an opportunity, that’s the right time for an ADS.

### Planning
Prior to conducting an ADS:
- Identify: stakeholders, decision-makers, attendees, implementers. Who needs to be in the session?
- Qualify: the project, stakeholders objectives, technical team objectives.
- Review the reference architecture for the project’s workload, industry, and technology.
- Prepare to explain any gaps that were found in the reference-architecture review.
- Schedule: local resources, delivery owners.

### Agenda
On a call with the customer, confirm that they are ready for an ADS. The outcome of the call should be a mutual understanding of:
- Goals and requirements for the solution.
- Logistics of the project.
- A high-level agenda for the ADS.
- A list of participants for the ADS (6 to 8 people for optimal decision-making).

The ADS usually runs over two days. During the session, four main topics—business capabilities, data flow, technology, and information flow—should be discussed. Review the table below to learn more about the structure, activities, and timeline of the ADS.
