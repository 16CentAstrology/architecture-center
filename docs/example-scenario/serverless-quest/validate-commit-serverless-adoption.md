# Validate and commit the serverless adoption
Perform application assessment, conduct or attend technical workshops that foster learning and adoption, identify a PoC or pilot project to execute, conduct architectural designs sessions to validate requirements.
As you get started, the checklist and resources below will help you validate and commit the serverless adoption. You should be able to answer these questions:
- Have you verified the main characteristics of the application? How complex or risky is this application to use serverless technologies?
- Have the application technical team prepared to use serverless technologies?
- Have you validated business requirements and transform to functional and no-functional requirements?

| Checklist | Resources |
|------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Execute an application assessment.** Certify if the main aspects of the application are being evaluated and to determine how complex and risky it is to adopt rearchitect (application modernization) or rebuild (new cloud-native application) strategies. | [Application assessment](./application-assessment.md) |
| **Promote a technical workshop.** Host a serverless workshop that foster Azure Functions learning and adoption using presentation decks, trainer and student guides, and hands-on lab guides. | [Technical Workshop](./technical-workshops.md) |
| **Conduct architectural design session(s).** An architectural design session (ADS) is necessary when you need an in-depth discussion on how a new solution will blend into the environment. ADSs validate and transform business requirements in functional and no-functional requirements. | [Architectural Design Sessions](./ads.md) |
| **Identify and execute a PoC or Pilot project.** Proof of Concept (PoC) or pilot is an opportunity to deliver evidence that the Azure Functions will solve your business problems. With the right technical resource, you can identify pilot project and execute PoC to modernize an existing app or build a new cloud-native app. | PoC or Pilot |
| **Plan technical trainings for the project team.** Ensure application team completes requisite technical trainings for app modernization or cloud native apps. | Technical training plan |
| **Deliver a technical implementation with the team or customer.** Code-with enable teams to be successful with building and operating their application. Deliver a technical implementation with the team or customer to modernize and/or build a new application to their specification can accelerate a deployment to production environment. | Deliver Technical Implementation |
