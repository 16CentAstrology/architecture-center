# Plan serverless Functions adoption

To plan serverless Azure Functions adoption, a technical decision maker (TDM) or architect:
- Verifies an application's characteristics and business requirements
- Determines the app's suitability for serverless Azure Functions adoption
- Transforms business requirements into functional and other requirements

Planning activities also include assessing technical team readiness, providing or attending workshops and training, and conducting design reviews, proofs of concept, pilots, and technical implementations.

TDMs and architects may perform one or more of the following activities:

- **Execute an application assessment.** Evaluate the main aspects of the application to determine how complex and risky it is to rearchitect through application modernization, or rebuild a new cloud-native application. See [Application assessment](./application-assessment.md).

- **Attend or promote technical workshops and training.** You can host a Serverless workshop or CloudHack, or use many other training and learning opportunities for serverless technologies, Azure Functions, app modernization, and cloud-native apps. See [Technical workshops and training](./technical-training.md).

- **Identify and execute a Proof of Concept (PoC), pilot, or technical implementation.** Deliver a PoC, pilot, or technical implementation to provide evidence that serverless Azure Functions can solve a team's business problems. Showing teams how to modernize or build new cloud-native applications to their specifications can accelerate deployment to production. See [PoC or Pilot](./poc-pilot.md) and [Code-with engineering playbook](./code-with.md).

- **Conduct architectural design sessions.** An architectural design session (ADS) is an in-depth discussion on how a new solution will blend into the environment. ADSs validate and transform business requirements to functional and other requirements. See [Architectural design sessions](./ads.md).


## Next steps
For example scenarios that use serverless architectures with Azure Functions, see [Serverless reference architectures](./reference-architectures.md).

To move forward with serverless Azure Functions adoption, see the following resources:
