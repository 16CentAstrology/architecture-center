# Technical trainning plan
This is a recommended technical training plan for serverless adoption with Azure Functions. This plan can help you to ensure you or  your team to complete the required technical trainnigs for application modernization or cloud native apps.

## Microsoft Learning (Online and Free)
[Microsoft Learn](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/) is a free, online training platform that provides interactive learning for Microsoft products. The goal is to help you become proficient on our technologies with fun, guided, hands-on, interactive content that's specific to your role and goals. Learning paths are collections of modules that are organized around specific roles (like developer, architect, or system admin) or technologies (like Azure Web Apps, Azure Functions, or Azure SQL DB). When you finish a learning path, you've gained a new understanding of different aspects of the technology or role you're studying. 

These are the recommended learning paths related to Azure Functions:
- [Create serverless applications](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/paths/create-serverless-applications/). Learn how to leverage functions to execute server-side logic and build serverless architectures.
- [Architect message brokering and serverless applications in Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/paths/architect-messaging-serverless/). Learn how to create reliable messaging for your applications, and how to take advantage of serverless application services in Azure.
- See [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/browse/?products=azure-functions) more learning paths about Azure Functions.

## Instructor-led (Paid)
[Course AZ-204: Developing solutions for Microsoft Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/certifications/courses/az-204t00). This course teaches developers how to create end-to-end solutions in Microsoft Azure. Students will learn how to implement Azure compute solutions, create **Azure Functions**, implement and manage web apps, develop solutions utilizing Azure storage, implement authentication and authorization, and secure their solutions by using KeyVault and Managed Identities. Students will also learn how to connect to and consume Azure services and third-party services and include event- and message-based models in their solutions. The course also covers monitoring, troubleshooting, and optimizing Azure solutions.

## Serverless OpenHack
This OpenHack enables attendees to quickly build and deploy Azure Serverless solutions that are comprised of cutting-edge compute services like **Functions**, Logic Apps, Event Grid, Service Bus, Event Hubs and Cosmos DB. The OpenHack simulates a real-world scenario where a company wants to utilize serverless services to build and release an API to integrate into their distributor’s application. During the “hacking” attendees will focus on:
- building serverless functions, web APIs, and CI/CD pipeline to support them and, then, 
- implementing further Serverless technologies to integrate LOB app workflows, process user/data telemetry and create business KPI-aligned reports. By the end of the OpenHack, attendees will have built out a technical solution that is a full serverless solution which can create workflows between systems and handle events, files, and data ingestion.

Ten challenges inspired by Microsoft customer projects: 
- Developer environment configuration
- Create your first serverless function & workflow
- Build APIs to support business needs
- Deploy management layer for APIs and monitor usage
- Build LOB workflow process
- Process large amounts of unstructured file data
- Process large amounts of incoming event data
- Publisher/Subscriber messaging pattern and virtual network integration 
- Sentiment analysis
- Data aggregation, analysis, and reporting.

Technologies: Azure Functions, Logic Apps, Event Grid, Cosmos DB, API Management, Event Hubs, Azure Dev Ops or GitHub (team choice), Application Insights, Dynamics 365/Office 365, Cognitive APIs, Service Bus.
