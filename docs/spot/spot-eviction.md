# Azure Virtual Machine Spot Eviction

You can take advantage of Azure's unused capacity at a significant cost savings by using Spot virtual machines (VM) and scale sets (VMSS). However, at any point in time when Azure needs the capacity back, the Azure infrastructure will evict Azure Spot VMs. Therefore, Azure Spot VMs are great for workloads that can handle interruptions like batch processing jobs, dev/test environments, and large compute workloads. This guide is meant to walk you through Azure Spot Eviction fundamentals and help you design a solution to support workload interruptions.

## Cost

Azure provisions its spare capacity along all its offered regions so it can respond on demand when new resources are created. While that capacity remains idle, you have an opportunity to deploy VMs in your subscription at [discount prices and capped at pay-as-you-go prices using Azure Spot VMs and VM scale sets](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/spot-advisor/).

Keeping operational expenses under control is common practice when running solutions on the cloud and the [cost optimizations pillar from the Well Architected Framework](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/architecture/framework/cost/overview) can help you find the right strategy for your architecture.

## Purpose

While the number one reason to choose Azure Spot is the significant cost savings at the infrastructure level, keep in mind that you need to build reliable **interruptible** workloads that can run on top of this Azure managed service.

The goal is to design a framework that is fault tolerant and resilient, so that it is capable of being unexpectedly and reliably interrupted. Successful designs have workloads that are able to deal with high levels of uncertainty at the time of being deployed and can recover after being forcedly shutdown. Even better, they can gracefully shutdown with under 30 seconds of notification prior to eviction.

## Potential workloads

Some good candidates to run on top of Azure Spot VMs are:

- Batch processing applications
- Workloads that are not time critical for background processing jobs
- Large workloads that are not required to finish in a certain period of time (ex. data analytics)
- Tasks that are optional or have lower priority (ex. spawning a CI/CD agent for a dev/test environment)
- Short lived jobs that can lose their progress repeatedly without having an affect on the end result

Azure Virtual Machine Scale Sets (VMSS) is also offered with priority **Spot** and is an underlying service that will represent nodes for an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster. As a result, stateless applications as well as opportunistic scale out scenarios are possible candidates to build with Azure Spot VMSS in mind if they are meant to run from an AKS cluster. The AKS use case is out of scope in this reference implementation. 

Avoid using Azure Spot if:

- Your application is under a strict SLA that could be compromised by compute interruptions
- You are planning to provision sticky session solutions
- Your workload is not designed to be interrupted
- Your workload is stateful by nature

## Considerations

We recommend that any `production` workloads keep a guaranteed amount of Azure VM instances with **Regular Priority** in addition to VMs with **Spot priority**. This way you can optimize your costs and remain in compliance with your application SLA. If your workload is capable of being consistently interrupted and it doesn't need an SLA, you might consider going full **Spot Priority** even in `production`.

Azure Spot VM/VMSS are compute infrastructure as a service (IaaS) available in Azure that serves without an SLA once created. This means that it can be terminated at any moment with *up to* 30 seconds of notification. In other words, at any point in time when Azure needs the capacity back, the Azure infrastructure will evict the service by deallocating or deleting the resources based on your configured eviction policy.

You are acquiring unused (if any) ephemeral compute capacity that offers no high availability guarantees. Given that, Azure Spot VM/VMSS is a limited resource that wonâ€™t always be at your disposal.

## Spot VM states

Azure Spot VM/VMSS instances will transition states and your workload must be able to behave accordingly. The diagram below visualizes the following states:

1. Stopped or Deleted (eviction policy based)
1. Running (based on capacity and max price you set)

![State diagram depicting how Azure VM Spot VM/VMSS behaves depending on policy, capcity ad price.](./spot-statediagram.png)

The following table breaks down the expected outcome and state for a Spot VM based on the VMs current state, the input it receives from the Azure infrastructure, and the conditions you set (price limits and eviction policy).

| Current State  | Input   | Conditions                                                                     | Next State | Output                                                                                                               |
|----------------|---------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

| Running        | Evict   |                                Capacity = Unavailable and Policy = Deallocate  | Stoped     | Compute capacity gets deallocated while you pay for underlying disk. It is possible to restart the machine          |
| Running        | Evict   |                                Capacity = Unavailable and Policy = Delete      | Deleted    | You are not charged at this point since disks are deleted                                                            |
| Running        | Evict   | Max Price <  Current Price                            and Policy = Deallocate  | Stoped     | You pay for underlying disk and can restart the machine                                                             |
| Running        | Evict   | Max Price <  Current Price                            and Policy = Delete      | Delete     | You are not charged at this point since disks are deleted                                                            |
| Stoped         | Restart | Max Price <  Current Price                            and Policy = Deallocate  | Stoped     | You pay for underlying disk and can restart the machine                                                             |
| Stoped         | Restart | Max Price <  Current Price                            and Policy = Delete      | Delete     | You are not charged at this point since disks are deleted                                                            |
| Stoped         | Restart | Max Price >= Current Price and Capacity = Available                            | Running    | You pay the Max Price you set and underlying disks                                                                  |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If a constraint capacity event occurs at a particular location and/or the current market price surpass the Max Price you set, the Azure infrastructure will collect its compute capacity for the Azure Spot VM according to your configured **Eviction Policy**. If you configured your Azure Spot VM for **deallocation** under an eviction event, it is the application operator's responsibility to automatically or manually restart the Azure Spot VM once the capacity becomes available.

## Concepts

There are several important considerations when building on top of Azure Spot VM instances. 

### Subscription Limits

There are 20 cores per subscription by default. Some subscriptions are not supported. Take a look at the list of supported supported types for more information. <!--- Insert link to list here. --->

### Eviction

There are several conditions that affect an eviction. The following list goes into detail on every element you should consider.

1. **Rate** - It is nothing but the chances of being evicted at a specific location. A common practice is to choose the location based on the eviction rate by SKU querying the pricing history view from Azure Portal in addition to [Azure Spot advisor](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/spot-advisor/).

1. **Type** - You can choose between **Max Price or Capacity** or **Capacity Only**.
    1. **Capacity** - When using Azure Spot VMSS with **Manual** scaling, a good practice is to enable the **Try to Restore** option if your policy eviction is **Deallocate**. If the Azure infrastructure evicted and too capacity back, this configuration looks for those clusters that have the most spare capacity and will attempt to redeploy your deallocated instances on top of them. This configuration provides your Azure Spot VMSS with better chances of surviving next time an eviction event kicks in. When configured with **Autoscale**, this option is not available as this implements its own logic to reallocate instances.
        1. VM Configuration: as flexible as choosing the SKU, the better are chances to be allocate Azure Spot VM/VMSS. Some SKU(s) like B-series or Promo versions of any size are not supported.
        1. Location: same as in SKU, if your workload can run from any region, it improves the chances to be deployed as well as with less chances of being deallocated if you choose carefully considering the eviction rates. Please take into account that Microsoft Azure China 21Vianet is not supported.
        1. Time of the Day, Weekends, Seasons (i.e. Christmas), and other time based considerations are important factors when making a final decision between Azure Spot over regular VMs/VMSS.
    1. **Current VM Price vs Max Price** (you set): if you are willing to pay up to the **Pay as you go** rate, it is possible to prevent from being evicted based on price reasons by setting the your **Max Price** to `-1` wich is known as **Eviction Type Capacity Only**. If pricing is a constraint for your business organization goals, **Eviction Type Max Price or Capacity Only** is recommended for you, and in this case you can adjust the right **Max Price** at any moment by taking into account that changing this value requires to deallocate the VM/VMSS first to take effect. If you choose the later, it is good idea to analyze the price history and **Eviction Rate** for the regions you are targeting to.

1. **Policy**:
    1. Delete
        1. You free up the Cores from your Subscription, so shared subscriptions or multiple workloads using Azure Spot VM instances can be befitted from this.
        1. You are not longer charged for the disk as they get deleted along with the Azure Spot VM
    1. Deallocate
        1. Change VM state to the stopped-deallocated state
        1. Allowing you to redeploy it later.
        1. You are still being charge for the underlaying disks
        1. It consumes Cores quota from your Subscription

1. **Simulation** - It is possible to [simulate an eviction event](/azure/virtual-machines/spot-portal#simulate-an-eviction.md) when Azure needs the capacity back. We recommend you become familiar with this concept so that you can simulate interruptions from dev/test environments to guarantee your workload is fully interruptible before deploying to production.

### Events

[Azure Scheduled Events](/azure/virtual-machines/windows/scheduled-events.md) is a metadata service in Azure that signal about forthcoming events associated to the Virtual Machine resource type. The general recommendation when using Virtual Machines is to routinely query this endpoint to discover when maintenance will occur, so you are given the opportunity to prepare for disruption. One of the platform event types being scheduled that you will want to notice is `Preempt` as this signals the imminent eviction of your spot instance. This event is scheduled with a minimum amount of time of 30 seconds in the future. Given that, you must assumme that you are going to have less than that amount of time to limit the impact. The recommended practice in here is to check this endpoint based on the periodicity your workload mandates (i.e. every 10 seconds) to attempt having a gracefully interruption.

## The Workload

One of well-suited workload types for Azure Spot VM are batch processing apps. This reference implementation contains a simple and asyncronously queue-processing worker (C#, .NET 6) implemented in combination with [Azure Queue Storage](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/queues/storage-queues-introduction) and demostrate how to query the [Azure Scheduled Events] REST endpoint that allows the workload to be signaled prior to eviction so it can anticipate such disruption event and prepare for interruption limiting its impact.

### Planning for being Fault Tolerant

When building reliable interruptible workloads, you will be focused on four main stages during their lifecycle that will derive into changes of states within your application:

1. Start: after the application `warmup` state is completed, you could consider internally transitioning into `processing` state. An important aspect to contemplate is a previous forced shutdown having as side effect some incomplete processing, so the recommendation is to implement idempotency when applicable. Additionally, it is a good practice to save the context by creating checkpoints regularly. This enables a more efficient recovery strategy which is recover from the latest well-known checkpoint instead of starting all over the processing again.
1. Shutdown: your workload is in `processing` state, and at the same time an eviction event is triggered by the Azure infrastructure. Compute capacity must be collected from Azure Spot instances, and as a result an eviction notice will take place in your application. It is time for your application to change the state to `evicted`, and implement the logic to respond by gracefully shutting down within 30 secs by releasing resources such us draining connections, event logging, or prepare to be forcedly deallocated or deleted based on your **Evition Policy**. In the later configuration, as a general practice you can not persist any progress or data on the file system since disks are being removed along with the Azure VM.
1. Recover: as part of this stage, your workload is `redeployed` or `recreated` depending on your **Eviction Policy** preference. These possible states during a recovery are dectected. You implement the logic to deal with a prior forced shutdown so it is capable of recovering from a previous backup/checkpoint if neeeded.
1. Resume: the application is about to continue processing after a best effort to recover the context prior to eviction. It is good idea to transition into `warmup` state to ensure the workload is healthy and ready to start.

> The aforementioned states are just a reduced list of possible valid conditions for an reliable interruptible workload. You might find others that are convenient for your own workloads.

#### Expected Results

Following the steps below will result in the creation of the following Azure resources that will be used throughout this Reference Implementation.

| Object                                    | Purpose                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
|-------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| A Resource Group                          | Contains all of your organization's related networking, and copmute resources.                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| A single Azure Spot VM instance           | Based on how flexible you can be you selected an Azure VM size, and it gets deployed so your interruptible workloads can be installed and executed from there. In this Reference Implementation, the `Standard_D2s_v3` size was chosen and the VM is assigned a System Managed Identity to give it Azure RBAC permissions as a Storage Queue Consumer. |
| A Virtual Network                         | The private Virtual Network that provides with connectivity over internet to the Azure VM so it can be accessed. For more information, please take a look at [Virtual networks and virtual machines in Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-network/network-overview). For VNET enabled VMs like this, the [Azure Scheduled Events] Metadata Service is available from a static nonroutable IP. |
| A Network Card Interface                  | The must have NIC that will allow the interconnection between a virtual machine and a virtual network subnet.                                                                                                                                                                    |
| A Spot VM Subnet                          | The subnet that the VM is assigned thought its NIC. The subnet allows the NIC to be assigned with a private IP address within the configured network adrress prefix.                                                                                                             |
| A Bastion Subnet                          | The subnet that the Azure Bastion is assigned to. The subnet supports applying NSG rules to support expected traffic flows, like opening port **22** against the Spot VM private IP. |
| An Azure Bastion                          | The Azure Bastion that allows you to securely communicate with over Internet from your local computer to the Azure Spot VM. |
| A Public IP address                       | The public IP address of the Azure Bastion host. |
| A Storage Account (diagnostics)           | The Azure Storage Account that stores the Azure Spot VM boot diagnostics telemetry.  |
| A Storage Account (queue)                 | The Azure Storage Account that is a component of the interruptible workload, that represents work to be completed. |

![Depict the Azure Spot VM infrastructure diagram after deployment](./spot-deploymentdiagram.png)

> **Note**
> :bulb: Please note that the expected resources for the Spot instance you about to create are equal to what you would create for a regular Azure Virtual Machine. Nothing is changed but the selected **Priority** which is set to **Spot** in this case, while creating an on-demand it would have been set to **Regular**.

#### Planning

At this point, you have learnt that as an Architect you are tasked at being flexile which could be translated into look for as many options as you can find that align well with your organization business goals in terms of budget while at the same time this selection meet the non-functional requirements at the capacity level for your workload.

1. Get acquiented with the VM sizes Azure can offer you, and try to pick out some of them. The following command list VM Skus in `US East 2` that has a number of cores not greather than `8` by excluding from the results not supported options when using Azure Spot VM/VMSS instances:

   > **Note**
   > :bulb: In the future when creating your own interruptible workload ensure you right size your compute requirements, and include the filters in the following query or consider using the [Virtual machine selector tool](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/vm-selector/).

   ```bash
   az vm list-sizes -l eastus2 --query "sort_by([?numberOfCores <=\`8\` && contains(name,'Standard_B') == \`false\` && contains(name,'_Promo') == \`false\`].{Name:name, Cores:numberOfCores, RamMB:memoryInMb, DiskSizeMB:resourceDiskSizeInMb}, &Cores)" --output table
   ```

   The command above display an output similar to the following:

   ```output
   Name                  Cores    RamMB    DiskSizeMB
   --------------------  -------  -------  ------------
   Standard_D1_v2        1        3584     51200
   Standard_F1           1        2048     16384
   ...
   Standard_D2_v2        2        7168     102400
   Standard_D11_v2       2        14336    102400
   ...
   Standard_D12_v2       4        28672    204800
   Standard_F4           4        8192     65536
   ...
   Standard_NC6s_v3      6        114688   344064
   Standard_NV6          6        57344    389120
   ...
   Standard_E8as_v4      8        65536    131072
   Standard_D4           8        28672    409600
   ...
   ```

1. Before laying out an infrastructure proposal, you have to be aware about pricing. You can navigate to the [Azure Spot advisor] to contrast alternatives you have found from the previous step to apply another fitler more budget related for a final cherry-pick. Alternatively, if you had installed JQ you could execute the following command:

   ```bash
   curl -X GET 'https://prices.azure.com/api/retail/prices?api-version=2021-10-01-preview&$filter=serviceName%20eq%20%27Virtual%20Machines%27%20and%20priceType%20eq%20%27Consumption%27%20and%20armRegionName%20eq%20%27eastus2%27%20and%20contains(productName,%20%27Linux%27)%20and%20contains(skuName,%20%27Low%20Priority%27)%20eq%20false' --header 'Content-Type: application/json' --header 'Accept: application/json' | jq -r '.Items | sort_by(.skuName) | group_by(.armSkuName) | [["Sku Retail[$/Hour] Spot[$/Hour] Savings[%]"]] + [["-------------------- ------------ ------------ ------------"]] + map([.[0].armSkuName, .[0].retailPrice, .[1].retailPrice, (100-(100*(.[1].retailPrice / .[0].retailPrice)))]) | .[] | @tsv' | column -t
   ```

   > **Note**
   > :bulb: You could modify this query by changing the filter for example to incorporte the VM sizes you are mostly interested in as well as specific regions.

   You should get an output similar as shown below:

   ```output
   Sku                        Retail[$/Hour]  Spot[$/Hour]  Savings[%]
   --------------------       ------------    ------------  ------------
   Standard_DC16ds_v3         1.808           0.7232        60
   Standard_DC16s_v3          1.536           0.6144        60
   Standard_DC1ds_v3          0.113           0.0452        60
   ...
   Standard_NC48ads_A100_v4   7.346           2.9384        60
   Standard_NC96ads_A100_v4   14.692          5.8768        60
   Standard_ND96amsr_A100_v4  32.77           16.385        50

   > :bulb: Provided you have choosen a **Max Price and Capacity** eviction policy, it is a good practice to regularly use the [Azure Retail Prices API] to check whether the **Max Price** you set is doing well against  **Current Price**. You might want to consider scheduling this query and respond with **Max Price** changes as well as gracefully deallocate the Virtual Machine accordingly.

#### Clone the repository

1. Clone this repository

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mspnp/interruptible-workload-on-spot.git
   ```
1. Navigate to the interruptible-workload-on-spot folder

   ```bash
   cd ./interruptible-workload-on-spot/
   ```
#### Deploy the Azure Spot VM

1. Create the Azure Spot VM resource group

   ```bash
   az group create -n rg-vmspot -l centralus
   ```

1. Create the Azure Spot VM deloyment

   ```bash
   az deployment group create -g rg-vmspot -f main.bicep
   ```

#### Package the workload

1. Navigate to the sample worker folder

   ```bash
   cd ./src
   ```

1. Build the sample workder

   ```bash
   dotnet build -c Release
   ```

1. Navigate to the output folder

   ```bash
   cd ./bin/Release/net6.0/
   ```

1. Package the worker sample

   ```bash
   zip -r worker.zip *
   ```

#### Clean up

1. Delete the Azure Spot VM resource group

   ```bash
   az group delete -n rg-vmspot -y
   ```

### Toublehshooting

#### Remote ssh using Bastion into the Spot VM

1. SSH into the new Spot VM. For detailed steps please take a look at [Connect to a Linux VM](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-machines/linux-vm-connect?tabs=Linux)

   ```bash
   az network bastion ssh -n bh -g rg-vmspot --username azureuser --ssh-key ~/.ssh/opsvmspots.pem --auth-type ssh-key --target-resource-id $(az vm show -g rg-vmspot -n vm-spot --query id -o tsv)
   ```

#### Manually copy the **worker.zip** file into the Spot VM

1. Open a tunnel using Bastion between your machine and the remote Spot VM

   ```bash
   az network bastion tunnel -n bh -g rg-vmspot --target-resource-id $(az vm show -g rg-vmspot -n vm-spot --query id -o tsv) --resource-port 22 --port 50022
   ```

1. Copy the file using ssh copy

   ```bash
   scp -i ~/.ssh/opsvmspots.pem -P 50022 src/bin/Release/net6.0/worker.zip azureuser@localhost:~/.
   ```

### VM sizing

[Virtual machine sizing guidelines](/windows-server/remote/remote-desktop-services/virtual-machine-recs) lists the maximum suggested number of users per virtual central processing unit (vCPU) and minimum VM configurations for different workloads. This data helps estimate the VMs you need in your host pool.

Use simulation tools to test deployments with both stress tests and real-life usage simulations. Make sure the system is responsive and resilient enough to meet user needs, and remember to vary the load sizes when testing.

## Deploy this scenario

Use the [ARM templates](https://github.com/Azure/RDS-Templates/tree/master/ARM-wvd-templates) to automate the deployment of your Azure Virtual Desktop environment. These ARM templates support only Azure Resource Manager's Azure Virtual Desktop objects. These ARM templates don't support Azure Virtual Desktop (classic).
