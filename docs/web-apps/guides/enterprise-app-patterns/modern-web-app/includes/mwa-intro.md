It provides principles for moving from monolithic architectures toward micro-service architectures that can more completely take advantage of cloud services and scalability. It is a follow-up to the [reliable web app pattern](../../overview.md#reliable-web-app-pattern) and provides guidance for the next steps in optimizing applications for cloud environments.
