# Enterprise App Patterns

The Enterprise App Patterns build on the principles of the Azure Well-Architected Framework. They focus on several well-architected principles that are essential for the entire cloud adoption journey. The reliable web app pattern helps ensure web apps are cost optimized, observable, and ingress secure. The pattern also shows you how to implement infrastructure as code and identity-centric security.

## Reliable web app pattern

The reliable web app pattern provides essential implementation guidance for web apps moving to the cloud. It defines how you should update (re-platform) your web app to be successful in the cloud. The reliable web app pattern focuses on minimal code changes, reliability design patterns, and managed services so you can rapidly adopt the cloud.

There's specific implementation guidance for .NET and Java web apps. There's a reference implementation (sample web app) for both .NET and Java. The reference implementation has the reliable web app pattern applied. You should follow right guidance for your web app and use the reference implementation to expedite your progress.

## Modern web app pattern

The modern web app pattern provides guidance for modernizing web apps in the cloud. It is a follow-up to the reliable web app pattern and provides guidance for the next steps in optimizing applications for cloud environments. Whereas the reliable web app pattern focuses on moving applications from on-premises to the cloud with minimal code changes, the modern web app pattern focuses on guidance for subsequent transformations to more fully realize the value of running applications in the cloud and move towards a micro-service architecture. The modern web app pattern uses the strangler fig pattern to move separable pieces of the solution into stand-alone services that can be versioned and scaled independently. By revisiting application architecture, the modern web app pattern provides improved flexibility and value.

The overriding principles of the modern web app pattern are those articulated by the Well Architected Framework â€“ resiliency, security, operational excellence, performance, and cost optimization. But the modern web app pattern goes beyond these original principles to derive additional subordinate principles specific to the process of transforming an existing application to be more service oriented. These principles include:

- Separation of concerns with independent versioning and scaling

- Asynchronous communication

- Fine-grained scalability

- Data autonomy

These principles are implemented with the following patterns:

- Strangler fig

- Queue-based load leveling

- Competing consumers

- Automatic horizontal scaling

- Health endpoint monitoring

- Containerized service deployment

Note that these principles and patterns are in addition to some articulated in the reliable web app pattern. Like the reliable web app pattern, the modern web app pattern adheres to principles of infrastructure as code, identity-centric security, and ingress security. Therefore, it also implements patterns familiar from the reliable web app: managed identities, private endpoints, secure secret management, and bicep deployment.
