Autoscaling ensures web app remain resilient, responsive, and capable of handling dynamic workloads efficiently. To implement autoscaling, follow these recommendations:

- *Automate scale-out.* Use [Azure autoscale](/azure/azure-monitor/autoscale/autoscale-overview) to automate horizontal scaling in production environments. Configure autoscaling rules to scale out based on key performance metrics, so your application can handle varying loads.

- *Refine scaling triggers.* Begin with CPU utilization as your initial scaling trigger if you are unfamiliar with your applicationâ€™s scaling requirements. Refine your scaling triggers to include other metrics such as RAM, network throughput, and disk I/O to better match your web application's behavior and ensure optimal performance.

- *Provide a scale out buffer.* Set your scaling thresholds to trigger before reaching maximum capacity. For example, configure scaling to occur at 85% CPU utilization rather than waiting until it reaches 100%. This proactive approach helps maintain performance and avoid potential bottlenecks.
