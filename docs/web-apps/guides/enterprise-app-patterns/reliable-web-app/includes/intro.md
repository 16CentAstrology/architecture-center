This article shows you how to implement the Reliable Web App pattern. The Reliable Web App pattern defines how you should modify web apps (replatform) when migrating to the cloud. The Reliable Web App pattern provides prescriptive architecture, code, and configuration guidance that aligns with the principles of the [Well-Architected Framework](/azure/well-architected/) (WAF).

| Benefits | Architecture updates | Code updates<br>(design patterns) | Configuration updates |
|----------|--------------|--------------|---------------|
| Cloud-optimized web app <br> High-value updates <br>Minimal code changes | PaaS solutions<br>Secure ingress<br>Network topology<br>Infrastructure reliability<br>Private endpoints | Retry pattern<br>Circuit-breaker pattern<br>Cache-aside pattern | <br>User authentication and authorization<br>Managed identities <br>Rightsized environments <br>Infrastructure as code <br> Monitoring|

### Why the Reliable Web App pattern?

The Reliable Web App pattern shows architects and developers how to optimize web apps for the cloud. It focuses on the high-value updates you need to make and minimal code changes to improve reliability, security, performance, and operational excellence.

### How to implement the Reliable Web App pattern?

The Reliable Web App pattern outlines how to select the right cloud services and design a secure architecture that meets your business requirements. The Reliable Web App pattern has you update your web app code with three design patterns that improve reliability and performance efficiency.
