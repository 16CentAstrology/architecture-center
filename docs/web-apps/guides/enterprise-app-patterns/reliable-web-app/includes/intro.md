This article shows you how to implement the Reliable Web App pattern. The Reliable Web App pattern defines how you should modify web apps (replatform) when migrating to the cloud. It aligns with the principles of the [Well-Architected Framework](/azure/well-architected/) and focuses on the essential changes you need to make to be successful in the cloud. These changes include three design patterns and other key updates to your web app (*see table*).

| Objectives | Design patterns | Key updates |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ▪ High-value updates <br>▪ Minimal code changes <br>▪ Cloud-ready web app | ▪ Retry <br> ▪ Circuit-breaker  <br>▪ Cache-aside | ▪ Managed identities <br>▪ Private endpoints <br>▪ Rightsized environments <br>▪ Infrastructure as code |
