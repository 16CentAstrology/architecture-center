Use the [Circuit Breaker pattern](/azure/architecture/patterns/circuit-breaker) to handle service disruptions that aren't transient faults. The Circuit Breaker pattern prevents an application from continuously attempting to access a nonresponsive service. It releases the application and avoids wasting CPU cycles so the application retains its performance integrity for end users.
