The initial step in transitioning to cloud computing is to articulate your business objectives. The Reliable Web App pattern emphasizes the importance of setting both immediate and future objectives for your web application. These objectives influence your choice of cloud services and the architecture of your web application in the cloud.

Example: The fictional company Relecloud sells tickets through its on-premises web application. Relecloud has a positive sales forecast and anticipates increased demand on their ticketing web app. To meet this demand, they defined the goals for the web application:

Apply low-cost, high-value code changes
Reach a service level objective (SLO) of 99.9%
Adopt DevOps practices
Create cost-optimized environments
Improve reliability and security
Relecloud's on-premises infrastructure wasn't a cost-effective solution to reach these goals. So, they decided that migrating their web application to Azure was the most cost effective way to achieve their immediate and future objectives.
