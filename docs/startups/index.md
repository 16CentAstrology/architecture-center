# Architecture for Startups

A startup is a unique business – its purpose is to take an as yet unproven product and test it in market, actively iterating on it until reaching a point of product market fit and beginning to actively scaling the product and the business.

This approach means that depending on the stage of the startup, as a developer, architect, or CTO (maybe even all three at once) you are responsible for distinct phases of development, which require fundamentally different approaches, and as such – different technology choices.

## Stages of Innovation

Kent Beck describes a three-stage process of innovation in the software product world. Those stages are Explore, Expand, and Extract.

### Explore

When a startup is in the explore stage, the imperative to invest small amounts of time and effort on numerous different options, knowing that most won’t do much better than break-even (and most will be worse). By making many small bets, the aim is to find one that pays of a thousand times over, and will lead to massive growth.

### Expand

Once a startup finds growth through exploration, you must shift gears to expand. This means effort is focused on doing whatever you can to unblock the continued growth of our product and company. From a technical perspective that means a focus on overcoming scaling challenges, but also increasing development velocity so that you can fully exploit the opportunity that scaling brings.

### Extract

Finally, as the pace of growth slows and you reach the limits of the market opportunity, comes extract. At this point, there is a lot to lose, so a more cautious approach is taken. This phase is characterized by margin expansion, reducing cost, and improving efficiencies while ensuring that the captured market is not lost.

## Building Your First Stack

As a startup’s first embodiment of their product, the first technology stack should be firmly rooted in exploration. That means promoting the stack must facilitate rapid iteration of the product without wasting any unnecessary effort investing in infrastructure or architecture that is not required for answering the current question.

Exploration means that you need to optimize for three things: speed, cost, and optionality. Speed is about how fast you can build and move forwards with an idea or move onto the next idea. Cost is how much you're spending to run our infrastructure. Optionality centers around being able to quickly changes directions rapidly using given architecture, allowing you to capitalize if you land on an idea that is successful and will lead to growth.

These three factors must be balanced – focusing too much on cost will cost you speed and optionality. Focusing too much on speed will often lead to increased costs, and reduced optionality. Designing for too many options builds complexity, increasing costs and reducing speed.
