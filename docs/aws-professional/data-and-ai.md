| [Microsoft Purview](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/purview/) | [AWS Glue Data Catalog](https://aws.amazon.com/glue/), [AWS Lake Formation](https://aws.amazon.com/lake-formation/), [Amazon Macie](https://aws.amazon.com/macie/), [AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)](https://aws.amazon.com/iam/), [AWS Config](https://aws.amazon.com/config/) | Both options offer robust data governance, cataloging, and compliance features, but they achieve these through different sets of tools and integrations. Microsoft Purview offers a unified data governance solution that allows organizations to discover, classify, and manage data across on-premises, multi-cloud, and SaaS environments with data lineage and compliance capabilities. AWS provides similar functionalities through multiple services: [AWS Glue Data Catalog](https://aws.amazon.com/glue/) for metadata management, [AWS Lake Formation](https://aws.amazon.com/lake-formation/) for data lake creation and governance, [Amazon Macie](https://aws.amazon.com/macie/) for data classification and protection, [AWS IAM](https://aws.amazon.com/iam/) for access control, and [AWS Config](https://aws.amazon.com/config/) for configuration management and compliance tracking. |

## All-in-one platform vs AWS services

Microsoft Fabric offers an all-in-one platform that unifies the various data and AI services needed for modern analytics solutions. It streamlines the process of moving data between services, ensures unified governance and security, and simplifies pricing models. This unified approach contrasts with AWS’s offerings, where services are often used separately and require more effort to integrate. Fabric’s seamless integration across these categories enables organizations to accelerate their data-driven initiatives within the Azure ecosystem.

Both AWS and Microsoft Fabric offer services for data integration, processing, analytics, machine learning, and business intelligence.

| [AWS Glue](https://aws.amazon.com/glue/), [AWS Data Pipeline](https://aws.amazon.com/datapipeline/) | [Data Integration (Data Factory experience)](https://learn.microsoft.com/fabric/data-factory/) | AWS provides a suite of individual services that can be combined to build data and analytics solutions, offering flexibility but requiring more effort to integrate. Microsoft Fabric provides these capabilities within a single, unified platform, simplifying workflows, collaboration, and management. While AWS services are modular and may require configuration and integration work to achieve end-to-end solutions, Microsoft Fabric's strength lies in its unified platform, bringing all components together with seamless integration, reducing complexity and enhancing collaboration. |
