# Mobile architecture design

The Azure platform can help you quickly build Android, iOS, and Windows apps that fit your business needs. You can use Azure to power your apps with intelligent back-end services and automate your development lifecycle to ship faster and with more confidence.

These are just some of the services that Azure provides to help you with mobile development and back-end infrastructure:

- [Azure App Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/app-service). Azure App Service enables you to build and host web apps, mobile back ends, and RESTful APIs in the programming language of your choice without managing infrastructure. Use [Mobile Apps](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/app-service/mobile), a feature of App Service, to create mobile apps for any device.

- [Visual Studio App Center](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/app-center). Build, test, release, and monitor your mobile apps.

- [Xamarin](https://azure.microsoft.com/features/xamarin). Create cloud-powered mobile apps faster.

- [Azure Communication Services](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/communication-services). Azure Communication Services is a set of rich communication APIs, video APIs, and SMS APIs for deploying your applications across any device, on any platform.

- [Notification Hubs](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/notification-hubs). Azure Notification Hubs is a massively scalable mobile push notification engine for sending notifications to iOS, Android, Windows, or Kindle devices.

- [Azure Maps](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/azure-maps). Azure Maps is a suite of geospatial services that can help you easily incorporate location-based data into mobile solutions.

- [Azure Cognitive Services](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/cognitive-services). Add cognitive capabilities to apps by using APIs and AI services.

## Introduction to mobile architecture on Azure

Continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) play an important part in a mobile development strategy.

## Path to production

Azure provides various options for development platforms and back-end services.

To learn about single-platform, cross-platform, and hybrid development frameworks, see [Choose a mobile development framework](/azure/developer/mobile-apps/choose-mobile-framework?toc=https%3A%2F%2Fdocs.microsoft.com%2Fazure%2Farchitecture%2Ftoc.json&bc=https%3A%2F%2Fdocs.microsoft.com%2Fazure%2Farchitecture%2Fbread%2Ftoc.json).

For information about source-code management, see [Cloud-hosted mobile application source code management](/azure/developer/mobile-apps/serverless-compute?toc=https%3A%2F%2Freview.docs.microsoft.com%2Fazure%2Farchitecture%2Ftoc.json&bc=https%3A%2F%2Freview.docs.microsoft.com%2Fazure%2Farchitecture%2Fbread%2Ftoc.json).

To start exploring options for other back-end services, see these articles:
