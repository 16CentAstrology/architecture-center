# Transition your workload from Service Fabric to AKS

Many organizations have moved to containerized apps as part of a push towards adopting modern app development, maintenance best practices, and cloud-native architectures. As technologies continue to evolve, organizations are evaluating the many containerized app platforms that are available in the public cloud.

There's no one-size-fits-all solution for apps, but organizations often find that the [Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)](/azure/aks/release-tracker) meets their requirements for many of their containerized applications. AKS is a hosted Kubernetes service that simplifies application deployments via Kubernetes by managing the control plane to provide core services for your application workloads. Most have moved towards standardizing AKS as their primary infrastructure platform and have begun transitioning workloads hosted on other platforms to AKS. The following article focuses on migrating containerized apps from [Azure Service Fabric](/azure/service-fabric/service-fabric-azure-clusters-overview) (ASF) to AKS. This article therefore assumes that you are already knowledgeable about ASF but are interested in how its features and functionality compare to AKS, while also providing a series of best practices to consider during the migration.

## Comparing the Azure Kubernetes Service to Service Fabric

To start, first take a look at this [article](../technology-choices/compute-decision-tree.yml) comparing the two hosting platforms alongside other Azure compute services. This section will highlight notable similarities and differences relevant to migration. 

While both Service Fabric and AKS are container orchestrators, Service Fabric offers support for several different programming models whereas AKS only supports containers.

- **Programming models:** Azure Service Fabric supports multiple ways to write and manage your services, including Linux and Windows containers, reliable services, reliable actors, ASP.NET Core, and Guest executables.  
- **Containers on AKS:** AKS is focused entirely on containerization with Windows and Linux containers running on  the container runtime [containerd](/azure/aks/cluster-configuration#container-runtime-configuration), which is managed automatically.

Both Service Fabric and AKS offer integrations with other Azure services including Azure Pipelines, Azure Monitor, Azure Key Vault, Azure Active Directory, and more.

## Key differences

When deploying a *Service Fabric [traditional cluster](/azure/service-fabric/service-fabric-azure-clusters-overview)*, you need to explicitly define a cluster resource alongside a number of supporting resources in your ARM templates or Bicep modules, such as a virtual machine scale set (VMSS) for each cluster node type, network security groups (NSG), load balancers, etc. It's your responsibility to make sure that these resources are correctly configured for your cluster services to function properly. The encapsulation model for *Service Fabric [managed clusters](/azure/service-fabric/overview-managed-cluster)* consists of a single, Service Fabric managed cluster resource. All underlying resources for the cluster are abstracted away and managed by Azure on your behalf.  

[Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)](/azure/aks/intro-kubernetes) simplifies deploying a managed Kubernetes cluster in Azure by offloading the operational overhead to Azure and is Azure’s flagship offering for developing and managing cloud native applications. As a hosted Kubernetes service, Azure handles critical tasks like infrastructure health monitoring and maintenance. Since Kubernetes masters are managed by Azure, you only manage and maintain the agent nodes. You can read more on Azure Kubernetes Service here: [Introduction to Azure Kubernetes Service](/azure/aks/intro-kubernetes). 

To move your workload from Service Fabric to AKS you will need to understand the differences in the underlying infrastructure so you can confidently and safely migrate your containerized applications. The following table compares the capabilities and features of the two hosting platforms: 


|Capability/Feature/Component|Service Fabric|Azure Kubernetes Service| 
|-|-|-|
|Non-containerized applications |Yes| No| 
|Linux and Windows containers |Yes|Yes| 
|Azure-managed control plane|No|Yes|
|Support for both stateless and stateful workloads|Yes|Yes|
|Worker node placement|VMSS – customer configured|VMSS – Azure managed |
|Configuration manifest |XML|YAML| 
|Azure Monitor integration |Yes|Yes|
|Native Support for Reliable Services and Reliable Actor Pattern|Yes|No|
|WCF-based communication stack for Reliable Services|Yes|No|
|Persistent Storage|Azure volume driver|Support for various storage systems such as managed disks, Azure Files, and Azure Blob Storage via CSI Storage classes, persistent volume, and persistent volume claims |
|Networking modes|Azure Virtual Network integration|Support for multiple network plugins (Azure CNI, kubenet, BYOCNI), network policies (Azure, Calico), and ingress controllers (Application Gateway Ingress Controller, NGINX, etc.)|
|Ingress Controllers |The [reverse proxy](/azure/service-fabric/service-fabric-reverseproxy) built into Azure Service Fabric helps microservices running in a Service Fabric cluster discover and communicate with other services that have http endpoints. You can also use [Traefik](https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/v1.7/configuration/backends/servicefabric/) on Azure Service Fabric.  |BYO Ingress Controllers (open source, commercial) that leverage Platform managed Public or Internal Load Balancers e.g. [NGINX Ingress Controller](https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/deploy/#azure) and [Application Gateway Ingress Controller](/azure/application-gateway/ingress-controller-overview) |

> [!Note]
> If you’re already using Windows containers on Service Fabric, we recommend keeping the same on AKS as the migration will be easier.

Example architecture 

AKS and Azure provide flexibility to configure your environment to fit your business needs. AKS can be configured in many ways and is well integrated with other Azure services. Below is an example architecture, the AKS baseline architecture.

Figure 1: Example [AKS Architecture](../../reference-architectures/containers/aks/baseline-aks.yml). 

As a starting point, we recommend that you familiarize yourself with key Kubernetes concepts for AKS and then take a look through some example architectures in AKS:

- [Concepts - Kubernetes basics for Azure Kubernetes Services (AKS) - Azure Kubernetes Service](/azure/aks/concepts-clusters-workloads) 
- [Baseline architecture for an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster](../../reference-architectures/containers/aks/baseline-aks.yml)

> [!Note]
> When migrating a workload from Service Fabric to Azure Kubernetes Service, [Service Fabric Reliable Actors](/azure/service-fabric/service-fabric-reliable-actors-platform) can be replaced with the Dapr [Actors](/azure/service-fabric/service-fabric-reliable-actors-platform) building block, while [Service Fabric Reliable Collections](/azure/service-fabric/service-fabric-reliable-services-reliable-collections) can be replaces using the Dapr [State Management](https://docs.dapr.io/developing-applications/building-blocks/state-management/state-management-overview/) building block. The [Distributed Application Runtime (Dapr)](https://dapr.io/) provides APIs that simplify microservice connectivity. Whether your communication pattern is service to service invocation or pub/sub messaging, Dapr helps you write resilient and secured microservices. For more information, see [Introduction to the Distributed Application Runtime](https://docs.dapr.io/concepts/overview/).

## Application and service manifest

Service Fabric and AKS differ in application and service manifest file types and constructs. Service Fabric uses XML files for application and service definition, while AKS uses Kubernetes’ YAML file manifest to define Kubernetes objects. There are no specific tools to migrate a Service Fabric XML file into a Kubernetes YAML file, however you can find more information on how YAML files work on Kubernetes here:

- Kubernetes official documentation: [Understanding Kubernetes Objects](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/kubernetes-objects/). 
- AKS documentation for Windows nodes/applications: [Create a Windows Server container on an AKS cluster by using Azure CLI](/azure/aks/learn/quick-windows-container-deploy-cli).

You can use [Helm](https://helm.sh/) to define parameterized YAML manifests and create generic templates by replacing static, hardcoded values with placeholders that can be filled in with custom values supplied at deployment time. The resulting templates with the values filled in are rendered as valid manifests for Kubernetes.  

[Kustomize](https://kustomize.io/) introduces a template-free way to customize application configuration that simplifies the use of off-the-shelf applications. You can use Kustomize as an alternative or companion tool to Helm.  

For more information on Helm and Kustomize, see the following resources:

- [Helm Documentation](https://helm.sh/docs/)
- [Artifact Hub](https://artifacthub.io/)
- [Kustomize Documentation](https://kubectl.docs.kubernetes.io/references/kustomize/)  
- [kustomization](https://kubectl.docs.kubernetes.io/references/kustomize/kustomization/)
- [Declarative Management of Kubernetes Objects Using Kustomize](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/manage-kubernetes-objects/kustomization/)

## Networking concepts

AKS provides two options for the underlying network: You can create a new Azure Virtual Network and place the AKS cluster in it, or you can let the AKS resource provider create a new Azure Virtual Network for you in the node resource group which contains all the Azure resources used by a cluster. If you choose the latter, Azure will manage the virtual network for you. 

Unlike ASF where you don’t have a choice, in AKS, you must select a network plugin:

- [Kubenet](/azure/aks/configure-kubenet): with *kubenet*, nodes get an IP address from the Azure virtual network subnet. Pods receive an IP address from a logically different address space to the Azure virtual network subnet of the nodes. Network address translation (NAT) is then configured so that the pods can reach resources on the Azure virtual network. The source IP address of the traffic is NAT'd to the node's primary IP address. This approach greatly reduces the number of IP addresses that you need to reserve in your network space for pods to use. 
- [Azure CNI](/azure/aks/configure-azure-cni): With [Azure Container Networking Interface (CNI)](https://github.com/Azure/azure-container-networking/blob/master/docs/cni.md), every pod gets an IP address from the subnet and can be accessed directly. These IP addresses must be unique across your network space, and must be planned in advance. Each node has a configuration parameter for the maximum number of pods that it supports. The equivalent number of IP addresses per node are then reserved up front for that node. This approach requires more planning, and often leads to IP address exhaustion or the need to rebuild clusters in a larger subnet as your application demands grow. You can configure the maximum pods deployable to a node at cluster create time or when creating new node pools.
- [Azure CNI Overlay networking](/azure/aks/azure-cni-overlay): With Azure CNI Overlay, the cluster nodes are deployed into an Azure Virtual Network (VNet) subnet, whereas pods are assigned IP addresses from a private CIDR logically different from the VNet hosting the nodes. Pod and node traffic within the cluster use an overlay network, and Network Address Translation (using the node's IP address) is used to reach resources outside the cluster. This solution saves a significant amount of VNet IP addresses and enables you to seamlessly scale your cluster to very large sizes. An added advantage is that the private CIDR can be reused in different AKS clusters, truly extending the IP space available for containerized applications in AKS. 
- [Azure CNI Powered by Cilium](/azure/aks/azure-cni-powered-by-cilium): Azure CNI Powered by Cilium combines the robust control plane of Azure CNI with the data plane of [Cilium](https://cilium.io/) to provide high-performance networking and security. 
- [Bring your own Container Network Interface (CNI) plugin](/azure/aks/use-byo-cni?tabs=azure-cli): Kubernetes does not provide a network interface system by default; this functionality is provided by [network plugins](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/compute-storage-net/network-plugins/). Azure Kubernetes Service provides several supported CNI plugins. Documentation for supported plugins can be found from the [networking concepts page](/azure/aks/concepts-network).

Currently, Windows containers only support the [Azure CNI]() plugin. Furthermore, customers have a variety of choices for network policies and ingress controllers.

In AKS you can use Kubernetes [Network Policies]() to segregate and secure intra-service communications by controlling which components can communicate with each other. By default, all pods in a Kubernetes cluster can send and receive traffic without limitations. To improve security, you can use [Azure Network Policies](/azure/aks/use-network-policies) or [Calico Network Policies](https://docs.tigera.io/calico/3.25/about/about-network-policy) to define rules that control the traffic flow between different microservices. To use Azure Network Policy Manager, you must use the [Azure CNI plug-in](https://github.com/Azure/azure-container-networking/blob/master/docs/cni.md). Calico Network Policy could be used with either this same Azure CNI plug-in or with the Kubenet CNI plug-in. Azure Network Policy Manager with Windows nodes is available on Windows Server 2022 only. For more information, see [Secure traffic between pods using network policies in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)](/azure/aks/use-network-policies). For more information on AKS networking, see [Networking in Azure Kubernetes Services (AKS)](/azure/aks/concepts-network).

In Kubernetes, an [ingress controller](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress-controllers/) acts as a service proxy and intermediary between a service and the outside world, allowing external traffic to access the service. The service proxy typically provides various functionalities such as TLS termination, path-based request routing, load balancing, and security features like authentication and authorization. On the other hand, ingress controllers provide an additional layer of abstraction and control for routing external traffic to Kubernetes services based on HTTP/HTTPS rules, providing more fine-grained control over traffic flow and traffic management. Ingress controllers can also perform TLS termination and provide other security features. 

In Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), there are multiple options for deploying, running, and operating an ingress controller. One option is to use the [Application Gateway Ingress Controller](/azure/application-gateway/ingress-controller-overview), which allows you to use Azure Application Gateway as the ingress controller for TLS termination, path-based routing, and [web access firewall](/azure/web-application-firewall/ag/ag-overview). Another option is to use the [NGINX ingress controller](/azure/aks/ingress-basic?tabs=azure-cli), which is an open-source, widely-used ingress controller that can be installed using Helm. Finally, [Traefik Ingress Controller](https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/providers/kubernetes-ingress/) is another popular option for ingress controller in Kubernetes. 

Each of these ingress controllers has its own strengths and weaknesses, and the choice of which one to use depends on the specific requirements of the application and the environment. It is important to ensure that you are using the latest release of Helm and have access to the appropriate Helm repository when installing an ingress controller.

## Persistent storage

Both Service Fabric and AKS provide mechanisms to present persistent storage to containerized applications. On Service Fabric, the Azure Files volume driver is a Docker volume plugin that provides Azure Files based volumes for Linux and Windows containers. It is packaged as a Service Fabric application that can be deployed to a Service Fabric cluster to provide volumes for other Service Fabric containerized applications within the cluster. More information on Azure files volume driver for Service Fabric can be found in [Azure Files volume driver for Service Fabric]().

Applications running in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) may need to store and retrieve data from a persistent file storage system. AKS integrates with Azure storage services such as [Azure managed disks](), [Azure Files](), and [Azure Blob Storage](), as well as 3rd party storage systems such as [Rook]() and [GlusterFS]() via CSI drivers. The [Container Storage Interface (CSI)]() is a standard for exposing arbitrary block and file storage systems to containerized workloads on Kubernetes. By adopting and using CSI, Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) can write, deploy, and iterate plug-ins to expose new or improve existing storage systems in Kubernetes without having to touch the core Kubernetes code and wait for its release cycles. 

The CSI storage driver support on AKS allows you to natively use the following Azure storage services: 

- [Azure Disks] can be used to create a Kubernetes *DataDisk* resource. Disks can use Azure Premium Storage, backed by high-performance SSDs, or Azure Standard Storage, backed by regular HDDs or Standard SSDs. For most production and development workloads, use Premium Storage. Azure Disks are mounted as *ReadWriteOnce* and are only available to one node in AKS. For storage volumes that can be accessed by multiple pods simultaneously, use Azure Files. Service Fabric supports creating a cluster or a node type with managed disks, but not applications that dynamically create attached managed disks using a declarative approach. For more information, see [Deploy an Azure Service Fabric cluster node type with managed data disks]().  
- [Azure Files]() can be used to mount an SMB 3.0/3.1 share backed by an Azure storage account to pods. With Azure Files, you can share data across multiple nodes and pods. Azure Files can use Azure Standard storage backed by regular HDDs or Azure Premium storage backed by high-performance SSDs. Azure Service Fabric provides an Azure Files volume driver as a [Docker volume plugin]() that provides [Azure Files]() based volumes for Docker containers. It is packaged as a Service Fabric application that can be deployed to a Service Fabric cluster to provide volumes for other Service Fabric container applications within the cluster. Azure Service Fabric provides two versions of the driver, respectively, for Windows and Linux clusters. 
- [Azure Blob storage]() can be used to mount Blob storage (or object storage) as a file system into a container or pod. Using Blob storage enables an AKS cluster to support applications that work with large unstructured datasets like log file data, images or documents, HPC, and others. Additionally, if you ingest data into [Azure Data Lake storage](), you can directly mount and use it in AKS without configuring another interim filesystem. Azure Service Fabric does not support any mechanism to mount a blob storage in a declarative mode. 

For more information on storage options see, [Storage in Azure Kubernetes Services (AKS)](). 

## Application and cluster monitoring

Both Service Fabric and AKS provide native integration with [Azure Monitor] and its services, such as [Log Analytics]. Monitoring and diagnostics are critical to developing, testing, and deploying workloads in any cloud environment. Monitoring encompasses infrastructure and application monitoring. For example, you can track how your applications are used, the actions taken by the Service Fabric platform, your resource utilization with performance counters, and the overall health of your cluster. You can use this information to diagnose and correct issues and prevent them from occurring in the future. For more information, see [Monitoring and diagnostics for Azure Service Fabric]. When hosting and operating containerized applications in a Service Fabric cluster, you need to set up the [Container Monitoring Solution]() to view container events and logs.  

AKS, on the other hand, has built-in integration with [Azure Monitor]() and [Container Insights]() that is designed to monitor the performance of containerized workloads deployed to the cloud. Container Insights provides performance visibility by collecting memory and processor metrics from controllers, nodes, and containers that are available in Kubernetes through the Metrics API. After you enable monitoring from Kubernetes clusters, metrics and Container logs are automatically collected for you through a containerized version of the Log Analytics agent for Linux. Metrics are sent to the [metrics database in Azure Monitor](). Log data is sent to your [Log Analytics workspace](). This allows customers to get monitor and telemetry data for both, the AKS cluster and the containerized applications running on top of it. For more information, see [Monitor Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) with Azure Monitor](). 

As an alternative or companion solution to [Container Insights](), you can configure your AKS cluster to collect metrics in [Azure Monitor managed service for Prometheus](). This allows you to collect and analyze metrics at scale using a Prometheus-compatible monitoring solution, based on the [Prometheus]() project from the Cloud Native Compute Foundation. This fully managed service allows you to use the [Prometheus query language (PromQL)]() to analyze and alert on the performance of monitored infrastructure and workloads without having to operate the underlying infrastructure. 

Azure Monitor managed service for Prometheus is a component of [Azure Monitor Metrics](), providing additional flexibility in the types of metric data that you can collect and analyze with Azure Monitor. Prometheus metrics share some features with platform and custom metrics, but use some different features to better support open source tools such as [PromQL]() and [Grafana](). 

You can configure [Azure Monitor managed service for Prometheus]() as a data source for both [Azure Managed Grafana]() and [self-hosted Grafana]() running in an Azure virtual machine using managed system identity authentication. For more information, see [Use Azure Monitor managed service for Prometheus (preview) as data source for Grafana using managed system identity]().

## Add-ons for Azure Kubernetes Service

Customers migrating from Service Fabric to AKS should consider leveraging add-ons and extensions. Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) provides additional, supported functionality for your cluster using add-ons and extensions such as [Kubernetes Event-driven Autoscaling (KEDA)]() and [GitOps Flux v2]() extensions. There are also many more integrations provided by open-source projects and third parties that are commonly used with AKS. These open-source and third-party integrations are not covered by the AKS support policy. For more information, see [Add-ons, extensions, and other integrations with Azure Kubernetes Service]().
