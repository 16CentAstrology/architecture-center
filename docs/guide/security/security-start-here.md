Azure provides a wide range of security tools and capabilities. These are just some of the key security services available in Azure:
- [Microsoft Defender for Cloud](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/defender-for-cloud/). A unified infrastructure security management system that strengthens the security posture of your data centers and provides advanced threat protection across your hybrid workloads in the cloud and on premises.
- [Azure Active Directory (Azure AD)](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/active-directory). The Microsoft cloud-based identity and access management service. Includes tools like Conditional Access, Azure AD Multi-Factor Authentication, and Identity Protection. 
- [Azure Front Door](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/frontdoor). A global, scalable entry-point that uses the Microsoft global edge network to create fast, secure, and widely scalable web applications.
- [Azure Firewall](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/azure-firewall). A cloud-native, intelligent network firewall security service that provides threat protection for your cloud workloads running in Azure.
- [Azure Key Vault](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/key-vault/). A high-security secrets store for tokens, passwords, certificates, API keys, and other secrets. Key Vault can also be used to create and control the encryption keys used to encrypt your data.
- [Azure Private Link](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/private-link). Enables you to access Azure PaaS Services (for example, Azure Storage and SQL Database) and Azure hosted customer-owned/partner services over a private endpoint in your virtual network. 
- [Azure Application Gateway](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/application-gateway). An advanced web traffic load balancer that enables you to manage traffic to your web applications. Application Gateway can make routing decisions based on additional attributes of an HTTP request, for example URI path or host headers.
- [Azure Policy](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/azure-policy). Helps to enforce organizational standards and to assess compliance at-scale.

## Introduction to security on Azure
If you're new to security on Azure, the best way to learn more is with [Microsoft Learn](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/?WT.mc_id=learnaka), a free online training platform. Microsoft Learn provides interactive learning for Microsoft products and more.

Here are two learning paths to get you started:

- [Microsoft Azure Fundamentals: Describe general security and network security features](/learn/paths/az-900-describe-general-security-network-security-features)
