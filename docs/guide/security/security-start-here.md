Azure provides a wide range of security tools and capabilities. These are just some of the key security services available in Azure:
- [Microsoft Defender for Cloud](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/defender-for-cloud/). A unified infrastructure security management system that strengthens the security posture of your data centers and provides advanced threat protection across your hybrid workloads in the cloud and on premises.
- [Azure Active Directory (Azure AD)](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/active-directory). The Microsoft cloud-based identity and access management service. Includes tools like Conditional Access, Azure AD Multi-Factor Authentication, and Identity Protection. 
- [Azure Front Door](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/frontdoor). A global, scalable entry-point that uses the Microsoft global edge network to create fast, secure, and widely scalable web applications.
- [Azure Firewall](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/azure-firewall) A cloud-native, intelligent network firewall security service that provides threat protection for your cloud workloads running in Azure.
- Azure Key Vault
- Azure Private Link 
- Azure Application Gateway 
- Azure Policy
