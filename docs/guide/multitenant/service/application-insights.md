# Multitenancy and Application Insights

Application Insights is a service that monitors the performance, availability, and usage of your web applications. It can help you identify and diagnose problems, analyze user behavior, and track key metrics. This article describes some of the features of Application Insights that are useful for multitenant systems. It also provides links to guidance and examples.

> [!TIP]
> Application Insights is designed and optimized for monitoring solutions. It's not intended to be used to capture every event that happens in a system, as you might need to do for auditing or billing. To learn about how you can measure usage for billing purposes, see [Considerations for measuring consumption in multitenant solutions](../considerations/measure-consumption.md).

## Isolation models

When you work with a multitenant system that uses Application Insights, you need to determine the required level of isolation. There are several isolation models that you can choose from. Here are some factors that might influence your choice:

- How many tenants do you plan to have?
- Do you share your application tier among multiple tenants, or do you deploy separate deployment stamps for each tenant?
- Are you or your customers sensitive about storing data alongside other tenants' data?
- Is the application tier of your solution multitenant, and the data tier single tenant?
- Do telemetry requirements vary among tenants?

> [!TIP]
> The main factors that determine the cost of Application Insights are the amount of data that you send to it and how long the data is retained. In a multitenant application, the overall cost is the same for a dedicated Application Insights instance as it is for a shared instance. For more information, see the [Azure Monitor pricing page](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/monitor/).

This table summarizes the differences between the main tenancy models for Application Insights:

| Consideration | Global shared Application Insights | Shared Application Insights per region/stamp | Dedicated Application Insights per tenant |
|-|-|-|-|
| **Data isolation** | Low | Low | High |
| **Performance isolation** | Low | Medium | High |
| **Deployment complexity** | Low-medium, depending on the number of tenants | Medium, depending on the number of tenants | High |
| **Operational complexity** | Low |Medium | High |
| **Example scenario** | Large multitenant solution with a shared application tier | Multitenant solution with regional deployments to better serve global customer base | Individual application instances per tenant |

### Global shared Application Insights instance
A single instance of Application Insights can be used to track telemetry for tenants in a multitenant application.  Benefits of this approach include simplified configuration and management of the application given that you have to instrument the application code only once.  Some of the drawbacks of this approach include limits and quotas associated with a single Application Insights instance. Review the [Application Insights limits](/azure/azure-monitor/service-limits#application-insights) to understand whether limits might affect your multitenant application.

In addition, when using a shared Application Insights resource, you may find it more difficult to isolate and filter the data for each tenant, especially if you have a large number of tenants. You may also have security and privacy concerns, as all tenants share the same Log Analytics workspace and instrumentation keys.

In order to address these concerns, you may need to implement extra logic and mechanisms to ensure that data can be filtered by tenant and your operations team, can properly see per-tenant data. Filtering can be accomplished by adding a [custom property](#custom-properties-and-metrics) to capture the tenant ID as part of every telemetry item. The tenant ID can then be used to query the data.

The following diagram illustrates this deployment model:

![Diagram showing global shared Application Insights isolation model.](media/application-insights/global-shared-app-insights.png)

### Shared Application Insights per stamp
Multitenant solutions often have multiple stamps, which might be deployed in different Azure regions. Stamps can enable you to serve tenants local to that particular region to offer better performance characteristics. A single stamp might serve a single tenant or a subset of your tenants. To learn more about stamps, see [Deployment stamps pattern](../approaches/overview.yml#deployment-stamps-pattern).

You might choose to deploy an Application Insights instance into each stamp, which is shared by all of the tenants using the stamp. This approach provides more flexibility with resource limits given that there are several Application Insights resources to work with across stamps.

The following diagram illustrates this deployment model:

![Diagram showing global shared Application Insights per stamp isolation model.](media/application-insights/shared-app-insights-per-stamp.png)

### Dedicated Application Insights resource per tenant
You might consider using a dedicated Application Insights resource for each tenant. This approach gives you more flexibility and control over the tenant's telemetry data, and provides you with the strongest data isolation. You can create different Application Insights resources allowing for configuring tenant specific settings and features such as different retention policies per tenant. At the same time, it requires you to deploy large number of Application Insights resources, manage tenant specific settings in a tenant catalog, and make application code changes when new tenants are onboarded.  Not that the decision to have a dedicated Application Insights resource per tenant is different from the decision to deploy application tier separately for each tenant.  For example, you can decide to deploy a single application instance in a stamp that is shared by multiple tenants and then have an Application Insights instance for each tenant.

You should consider this approach if you require a high degree of data isolation between your tenants, you need different configuration between tenants, or your needs are above the service limits of a single Application Insights instance.  

You may also have difficulty in aggregating and comparing the data across all tenants, as you need to query multiple Application Insight resources separately. If you follow this approach, consider using [cross-resource queries and Azure Monitor Workbooks](#unify-multiple-application-insights-resources-into-single-view).

The following diagram illustrates this deployment model:

## Features of Application Insights that support multitenancy


### Custom properties and metrics
Application Insights provides a way to enrich the telemetry data with custom properties and metrics. Custom properties are key-value pairs that can be attached to any telemetry item, such as a request or an event. Custom metrics are numerical values that can be tracked over time, such as a queue length or a score. By using custom properties and metrics, customers can add tenant-specific information to the telemetry data, such as tenant ID, tenant name, tenant location, and deployment stamp ID.

There are two ways to add custom properties to your telemetry: using the telemetry client or using telemetry initializers.

#### Telemetry Client
The [telemetry client](/azure/azure-monitor/app/api-custom-events-metrics) is an object that you can use to track any telemetry item. You can access the custom properties of any telemetry item through its `Properties` dictionary. The advantage of using the telemetry client is that you have full control over what custom properties you want to add and when. The disadvantage is that you have to access and modify each telemetry item that you want to enrich with custom properties.
#### Telemetry Initializers
The [telemetry initializer](/azure/azure-monitor/app/api-filtering-sampling?tabs=sdkloaderscript#addmodify-properties-itelemetryinitializer) is used to add additional information to all telemetry, or to modify properties set by the standard telemetry modules.

When you share an Application Insights instance across multiple tenants, the telemetry initializer is often a good place to inject the tenant ID into every telemetry item that can them be used to query and filter for reporting purposes. The advantage of using telemetry initializers is that you can apply custom properties to all or some of the telemetry items in one place without having to write code for each one. The disadvantage is that you have less control over what custom properties you want to add to each telemetry item and you may end up adding unnecessary or redundant data.

By adding custom properties to the telemetry data, using either of the mechanisms, you can use powerful features of Application Insights to monitor and analyze the multitenant application in a more granular and meaningful way. For example:

- They can use Metrics Explorer to create charts and graphs that show the performance and usage of the application for each tenant.
- They can use Analytics to write complex queries that filter, aggregate, and join the telemetry data by tenant-specific properties or metrics.
- They can use Alerts to set up rules that notify them when certain conditions are met or exceeded for a specific tenant.
- They can use Azure Monitor Workbooks to create interactive reports and dashboards that visualize the health and status of the application for each tenant.


### Unify multiple Application Insights resources into single view
There are several ways to unify data from multiple Application Insights resources, depending on your needs and preferences. Here are some of the options.
#### Cross-resource queries

Using cross-resource queries, data can be [queried](/azure/azure-monitor/logs/cross-workspace-query) from multiple Application Insights resources in a single query. The resources can be in same resource group, another resource group, or another subscription. As the number of Application Insights workspaces in a query increase, the query performance may degrade. There's a limit to the number of Application Insights workspaces that can be included in a single query. For more information, see [Query Across Multiple workspaces and apps](/azure/azure-monitor/logs/cross-workspace-query)
#### Azure Monitor workbooks
[Azure Monitor Workbooks](/training/modules/visualize-data-workbooks/) allow you to create interactive reports and dashboards using data from multiple sources, including Application Insights, thus providing a way to visualize and analyze data from multiple Application Insights resources in a single view.


## Latency
The time between the creation of data on the monitored system and its availability for analysis is referred to as [Latency](/azure/azure-monitor/logs/data-ingestion-time). Use of dedicated or shared Application Insights instance in a multitenant application doesn't have any bearing on latency unless the shared instance gets throttled and prevents data from being ingested resulting in increased latency.
## Rate limiting on ingestion
Ingestion rate limiting in Application Insights can be achieved through [sampling](/azure/azure-monitor/app/sampling) based on daily cap on the amount of telemetry data ingested by your service. Sampling helps in preventing Application Insights from throttling telemetry due to ingestion limits. Using fixed-rate sampling, you can determine an optimal sampling rate based on the number of tenants and the daily cap in order to say within the limits.
