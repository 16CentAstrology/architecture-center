Secure and efficient management of health data is critical for healthcare organizations. Azure Health Data Services provides a powerful platform for healthcare organizations to store, process, and analyze their sensitive data while adhering to stringent security and compliance standards. However, deploying AHDS in a complex enterprise environment can be challenging without a clear reference architecture and implementation guide.

This solution provides [AHDS](/azure/healthcare-apis/healthcare-apis-overview) an example architecture and an accompanying example implementation. This solution aims to empower healthcare customers by providing them with a clear blueprint for deploying AHDS securely and integrating it with various Azure services. By following the recommended best practices outlined in this guide, organizations can gain confidence in their ability to safeguard their health data effectively.

## Architecture

:::image type="content" source="./media/ahds-reference-architecture.png" alt-text="Architecture diagram showing how to deploy Azure Health Data Services securely on Azure and integrate with various Azure services." border="false":::

## Workflow

1. Azure Application Gateway receives individual (single) Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIRÂ®) data (for example patient data) over a secure TLS connection using a client credentials flow and sends it to the [AHDS FHIR Service](/azure/healthcare-apis/fhir/overview) to persist via API Management.
1. Simultaneously a client can read the same FHIR data (for example, patient data) over a secure TLS connection via Application Gateway and API Management using tools like Postman.
2. For bulk data processing, Azure Application Gateway securely receives FHIR bundles over a TLS connection using a client credentials flow and loads the data into a storage account. A VNet integrated [FHIR Loader](https://github.com/microsoft/fhir-loader) Function processes FHIR bundles and loads the data into the FHIR service.
3. If the incoming data is in HL7 V2 or in C-CDA format, then it can be converted to the FHIR format first using the [$convert-data](/azure/healthcare-apis/fhir/convert-data) endpoint in the FHIR service. The data can then be posted to the FHIR service via Application Gateway. Azure Container Registry (ACR) with private endpoint is used for securely storing customized liquid templates for converting HL7 V2/C-CDA data to FHIR data. While ACR is shown in the architecture diagram, HL7 V2/C-CDA to FHIR conversion using \$convert-data isn't implemented as part of the bicep implementation template.
4. FHIR to Synapse Sync Agent extracts data from the FHIR service (regardless of how the data ingested through individual or bulk data flow), converts the extracted data to hierarchical parquet files, and writes it to Azure Data Lake Gen2 (ADLS Gen2) storage. While the data extraction is shown in the architecture diagram, it's not implemented as part of the bicep implementation template. 
5. Azure Synapse uses serverless SQL/Spark pool to connect to ADLS Gen2 to query and analyze FHIR data. While Azure Synapse shown in the architecture diagram, it's not implemented as part of the bicep implementation template.
6. Hub virtual network contains jumpbox VM along with Azure Bastion Host to securely access FHIR service configuration. Admins/operators can also use jumpbox VM for testing FHIR service endpoints without Application Gateway and bulk loading FHIR data manually through Azure storage bypassing Application Gateway.
7. If on-premises network connectivity established over Express Route or Site-to-Site VPN then on-premises users/services can directly access FHIR service over this connection.

### Note

1. Optionally Web Application Firewall(WAF) can be added to Application Gateway, but there are known limitations with WAF misidentifying FHIR objects as malicious code. If WAF is needed, then your WAF ruleset needs to be manually tweaked to work with FHIR objects.

## Components

- [Azure Active Directory (Azure AD)](/azure/active-directory/) is a multitenant cloud-based directory and identity management service. [Client applications are registered](/azure/healthcare-apis/register-application) in the Azure AD and can be used to access the Azure Health Data Services FHIR service.

- [Azure Application Gateway](/azure/application-gateway/overview) is a platform as a service (PaaS) Layer-7 load balancer that can act as a reverse-proxy service. Internal and external users access the FHIR APIs through the App Gateway via the API Management service.

- [Azure API Management (APIM)](/azure/api-management/api-management-key-concepts) is a hybrid, multicloud management platform for APIs across all environments. FHIR APIs are imported in to API Management using the [Swagger API definition](https://fhir2apim.azurewebsites.net/). APIM can be used to throttle (rate-limit) inbound calls and authenticate/authorize users, among other uses.

- [Azure Health Data Services](/azure/healthcare-apis/get-started-with-health-data-services) is a set of managed API services based on open standards and frameworks that enable workflows to improve healthcare and offer scalable and secure healthcare solutions. FHIR Service under Azure Health Data Services deployed securely with private endpoint to ensure it can only be accessed from your virtual network. It can be accessed by external users over the internet via Application Gateway.

- [FHIR Loader](https://github.com/microsoft/fhir-loader) is an Azure Function App solution that provides services to import FHIR Bundles (compressed and non-compressed) and NDJSON files into a FHIR service.

- [Azure Key Vault](/azure/key-vault/general/overview) is an Azure service for storing and accessing secrets, keys, and certificates with improved security. Key Vault provides HSM-backed security and audited access through role-based access controls that are integrated with Azure AD. In this architecture, Key Vault stores jumpbox credentials, application gateway certificate, FHIR service details & FHIR Loader details.

- [Azure Container Registry](/azure/container-registry/container-registry-intro) is a managed registry service based on the open-source Docker Registry 2.0. In this architecture, it's used to host [Liquid](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/) templates. Using \$convert-data custom endpoint in the FHIR service, you can convert health data from various formats (HL7 V2, C-CDA) to FHIR. The \$convert-data operation uses Liquid templates from the [FHIR Converter](https://github.com/microsoft/FHIR-Converter) project for FHIR data conversion.

- [FHIR to Synapse sync agent](https://github.com/microsoft/FHIR-Analytics-Pipelines/blob/main/FhirToDataLake/docs/Deploy-FhirToDatalake.md) is an [Azure Container App](/azure/container-apps/) that extracts data from a FHIR server using FHIR Resource APIs, converts it to hierarchical parquet files, and writes it to Azure Data Lake in near real time. It also contains a script to create external tables and views in Synapse Serverless SQL pool pointing to the parquet files. While the architecture diagram shows FHIR to Synapse sync agent, Azure Data Lake Gen2 and Azure Synapse services, the bicep reference implementation doesn't include the code to deploy these services yet.

- [Azure Firewall](/azure/firewall/overview) is a cloud-native and intelligent network firewall security service that provides the best of breed threat protection for your cloud workloads running in Azure. In this architecture egress traffic from the Hub virtual network is routed through the Azure Firewall using a route table to ensure data exfiltration doesn't happen. Similarly, route table routes can be created and attached to necessary Spoke virtual network subnets as well to prevent any PHI data exfiltration.

- Jumpbox VM is an Azure virtual machine (VM) running Linux or Windows that users can connect to using Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) or Secure Shell (SSH). Given most services (AHDS, APIM, Key Vault, etc.) in this architecture are deployed using private endpoint, we need a jumpbox VM to make more configuration changes or test these services. The jumpbox VM can only be accessed through the Azure Bastion service.

- [Azure Bastion](/azure/bastion/bastion-overview) lets you connect to a virtual machine using your browser, Azure portal, or via the native SSH/RDP client already installed on your computer. In this implementation, we use Azure Bastion service to securely access the jumpbox VM.

- Microsoft Defender for Cloud along [HIPAA & HITRUST](/azure/governance/policy/samples/hipaa-hitrust-9-2) compliance policy initiatives ensures Azure infrastructure deployment adheres to Microsoft Security Benchmark and Healthcare industry compliance requirements.

## Scenario details

This solution provides guidance on how to securely deploy Azure Health Data Services, ingest individual & bulk FHIR data and persist the data into the AHDS FHIR service.

### Potential use cases

- Once the solution is deployed successfully, FHIR messages (individual/bulk) can be loaded into FHIR service securely via Application Gateway.
- FHIR data can be retrieved securely via Application Gateway & API Management. APIM provides more capabilities to authenticate/authorize incoming calls and throttle requests as needed.
- To analyze FHIR data and extract insights, the FHIR Sync Agent can be deployed as shown in the architecture diagram (not deployed part of Bicep script). The agent reads data from the FHIR service, converts that data to parquet files and writes it to Azure Data Lake Gen2 (ADLS Gen2) storage. Azure Synapse can connect to ADLS Gen2 to query and analyze FHIR data.
- This solution can be extended to receive medical devices/wearable data using [MedTech service](/azure/healthcare-apis/iot/overview) in AHDS, transform the data to FHIR format and persist into FHIR service for extracting further insights using Synapse.
- This solution can be extended to ingest non FHIR data (HL7 V2 & C-CDA), convert to FHIR standard using Liquid templates (can be stored in Azure Container Registry) and persist in FHIR service.
