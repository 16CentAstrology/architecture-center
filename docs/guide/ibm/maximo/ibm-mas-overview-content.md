## Contributors

<!-- > (Expected, but this section is optional if the principal authors would prefer to not include it)

> Start with the explanation text (same for every article), in italics. This makes it clear that Microsoft takes responsibility for the article (not the one contributor). Then include the "Pricipal authors" list and the "Additional contributors" list (if there are additional contributors). Link each contributor's name to the person's LinkedIn profile. After the name, place a pipe symbol ("|") with spaces, and then enter the person's title. We don't include the person's company, MVP status, or links to additional profiles (to minimize edits/updates). (The profiles can be linked to from the person's LinkedIn page, and we hope to automate that on the platform in the future).

_This article is being updated and maintained by Microsoft. It was originally written by the following contributors._
<!-- 
**Principal authors:** > Only the primary authors. List them alphabetically, by last name. Use this format: Fname Lname. If the article gets rewritten, keep the original authors and add in the new one(s). -->

 * [David Baumgarten](https://www.linkedin.com/in/baumgarten-david/) | Senior Cloud Solution Architect
 * [Roeland Nieuwenhuis](https://www.linkedin.com/in/roelandnieuwenhuis/) | Principal Cloud Solution Architect
 
<!-- * > Continue for each primary author (even if there are 10 of them). -->

<!-- 
**Additional contributors:** > Include contributing (but not primary) authors, major editors (not minor edits), and technical reviewers. List them alphabetically, by last name. Use this format: Fname Lname. It's okay to add in newer contributors.

 * [Contributor 1 Name](http://linkedin.com/ProfileURL) | [Title, such as "Cloud Solution Architect"]
