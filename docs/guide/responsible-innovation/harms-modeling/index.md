# Harms Modeling

## Foundations of assessing harm

As technology builders, your work is global. It has the power to shape society and profoundly impact the planet. Responsible innovation means taking care of the future through collective stewardship of research and innovation in the present. In the process of designing and building your technologies, it is essential to evaluate not only ideal outcomes, but possible negative ones as well. By assessing potential harms, you can identify gaps in products that could put people at risk, and ultimately create mitigation strategies.

Microsoft has made a commitment to building principled technology and helping the community to do the same. Collectively, we have the ability to create trustworthy systems that augment human ingenuity, and are built on foundational freedoms, core to human rights.

## Microsoft's Responsible AI Principles

* **Fairness** - Treat all stakeholders equitably and prevent stereotypes and biases.
* **Reliability & safety** - Build systems to perform safely even in the worst-case scenario.
* **Privacy & security** - Protect data from misuse and unintentional access to ensure privacy rights.
* **Inclusion** - Empower everyone, regardless of ability, and engage people by providing channels for feedback.
* **Transparency** - Create systems and outputs that are easily understandable.
* **Accountability** - Take responsibility for how systems operate and their impact on society.

## Technology and human rights

It is as important as ever to be aware of how digital technology could impact human rights. In addition to continuing to protect privacy and security, we must address the risks of AI and other emerging technologies, such as facial recognition. History teaches us that human rights violations not only result from the nefarious use of technology, but also from a lack of awareness amongst those with good intentions. As a part of our company's dedication to the protection of human rights, Microsoft forged a partnership with important stakeholders outside of our industry, including the United Nations (UN).

An important set of UN principles that our company firmly supports, which was ratified by over 250 nations, is the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR). The UDHR is a milestone document. Drafted by a diverse global group of legal and cultural experts, the Declaration was proclaimed by the United Nations General Assembly in 1948 as a common standard of achievements for all peoples and all nations. It sets out, for the first time, fundamental human rights to be universally protected. It has been translated into over 500 languages. Additionally, Microsoft is one of 4,700 corporate signatories to the UN Global Compact, an international business initiative designed to promote responsible corporate citizenship.
