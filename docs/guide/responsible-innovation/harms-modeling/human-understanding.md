# Human understanding

In addition to appreciating the importance of human rights, building trustworthy systems requires us to consider many people's perspectives. Asking who the stakeholders are, what they value, how they could benefit, and how they could be hurt by our technology is a powerful step that allows us to design and build better products.

## Who does the technology impact

### Who are the customers

- What do they value?
- How should they benefit?
- How could tech harm them?

### Who are the non-customer stakeholders

- What do they value?
- How should they benefit?
- How could tech harm them?

Asking these questions is a practice in [Value Sensitive Design](https://vsdesign.org/) and is the beginning to better understanding what is important to stakeholders, and how it plays into their relationship with the product.

## Types of stakeholders

### Project sponsors

Backers, decision makers, and owners make up this category. Their values are articulated in the project strategy and goals.

### Tech builders

Designers, developers, project managers, and those working directly on designing systems make up this group. They bring their own ethical standards and profession-specific values to the system.

### Direct & indirect stakeholders

These stakeholders are significantly impacted by the system. This includes end users, software staff, clients, bystanders, interfacing institutions, and even past or future generations. Non-human factors such as places (e.g. historic buildings or sacred spaces) may also be included.

### Marginalized populations

This category is comprised of those frequently considered a minority, vulnerable population, or stigmatized group. This includes children, the elderly, members of the LGBTQ+ community, ethnic minorities, and other populations who often experience unique and disproportionate consequences.
