## Type of harm: Infringement on human rights

## Dignity loss

Technology can influence how people perceive the world, and how they recognize, engage, and value one another. The exchange of honor and respect between people can be interfered with.

## Dehumanization

Removing, reducing, or obscuring visibility of a person's humanity.

- How might this technology be used to simplify or abstract the way a person is represented?
- How might this technology reduce the distinction between humans and the digital world?

*Example: Entity recognition and virtual overlays in drone surveillance could reduce the perceived accountability of human actions.*

## Public shaming

Exposing people's private, sensitive, or socially inappropriate material.

- How might movements or actions be revealed through data aggregation?

*Example: A fitness app could reveal a user's GPS location on social media, indicating attendance at an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting.*

Liberty loss

Automation of legal, judicial, and social systems can reinforce biases and lead to detrimental consequences.

## Predictive policing

Inferring suspicious behavior and/or criminal intent based on historical records.

- How could this support or replace human policing or criminal justice decision-making?

*Example: An algorithm can predict a number of area arrests, so police make sure they match, or exceed, that number.*

## Social control

Reinforcing or encouraging conformity by publicly designating human behaviors as positive or negative.

- What types of personal or behavioral data might feed this technology?
- How would it be obtained? What outputs would be derived from this data?
- Is this technology likely to be used to encourage or discourage certain behaviors?

*Example: Authoritarian government uses social media and e-commerce data to determine a "trustworthy" score based on where people shop and who they spend time with.*

## Loss of effective remedy

Inability to explain the rationale or lack of opportunity to contest a decision.

- How might people understand the reasoning for decisions made by this technology?
- How might an individual that relies on this technology explain the decisions it makes?
- How could people contest or question a decision this technology makes?

*Example: Automated prison sentence or pre-trial release decision is not explained to the accused.*

Privacy loss

Information generated by our use of technology can be used to determine facts or make assumptions about someone without their knowledge.

## Interference with private life

Revealing information a person has not chosen to share.

- How could this technology use information to infer portions of a private life?
- How could decisions based upon these inferences expose things that a person does not want made public?

*Example: Task-tracking AI could monitor personal patterns from which it infers an extramarital affair.*

## Forced association

Requiring participation in the use of technology or surveillance to take part in society.

- How might use of this technology be required for participation in society or organization membership?

*Example: Biometric enrollment in a company's meeting room transcription AI is a stipulated requirement in job offer letter.*

## Inability to freely and fully develop personality

Restriction of one's ability to truthfully express themselves or explore external avenues for self-development.

- In what way does the system or product ascribe positive vs negative connotations toward particular personality traits?
- In what way can using the product or system reveal information to entities such as the government or employer that inhibits free expression?

*Example: Intelligent meeting system could record all discussions between colleagues including personal coaching and mentorship sessions.*

## Never forgiven

Digital files or records that are never deleted.

- What and where is data being stored from this product, and who can access it?
- How long is user data stored after technology interaction? How is user data updated or deleted?

*Example: A teenager's social media history could remain searchable long after they have outgrown the platform.*

## Loss of freedom of movement or assembly

Inability to navigate the physical or virtual world with desired anonymity.

- In what ways might this technology monitor people across physical and virtual space?

*Example: A real name could be required in order to sign up for a video game enabling real-world stalking.*

## Environmental impact

The environment can be impacted by every decision in a system or product life-cycle, from the amount of cloud computing needed to retail packaging. Environmental changes can impact entire communities.

## Exploitation or depletion of resources

Obtaining the raw materials for a technology, including how it's powered, leads to negative consequences to the environment and its inhabitants.

- What materials are needed to build or run this technology?
- What energy requirements are needed to build or run this technology?

*Example: A local community could be displaced due to the harvesting of rare earth minerals and metals required for some electronic manufacturing.*

## Electronic waste

Reduced quality of collective well-being because of the inability to repair, recycle, or otherwise responsibly dispose of electronics.

- How might this technology reduce electronic waste by recycling materials or allowing users to self-repair?
- How might this technology contribute to electronic waste when new versions are released or when current/past versions stop working?

Toxic materials inside discarded electronic devices could leach into the water supply, making local populations ill.
