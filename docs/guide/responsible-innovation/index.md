## Harms Modeling

[Harms Modeling](./harms-modeling/index.md) is a framework for product teams, grounded in four core pillars of responsible innovation that examines how technology can negatively impact people's lives:

- Injuries
- Denial of consequential services
- Infringement on human rights
- Erosion of democratic & societal structures

Similar to *Security Threat Modeling*, Harms Modeling enables product teams to anticipate potential real-world impacts of technology, which is a cornerstone of responsible development.

This guidance is developed in partnership with the Green Software Foundation for an improved sustainability posture to help create new business value while reducing the operational footprint. This guide helps drive innovation responsibly by evaluating the impact workload design decisions have on the climate and gives concrete advice on how to build for a better tomorrow.
