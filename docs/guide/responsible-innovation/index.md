# Responsible Innovation: Best Practices Toolkit

Responsible Innovation is a people-first commitment to develop technology by anticipating at each stage of the product lifecycle how people’s lives might be negatively impacted by technology, and by bringing diverse stakeholders together to understand impacted stakeholders’ concerns so you can responsibly design, develop and deploy technology.

Designing trustworthy AI is the same: it requires creating solutions that reflect ethical principles that are deeply rooted in important and timeless values. 

That involves applying practices for all phases of the software development lifecycle: data collection, data governance, model training, system architecture, user experience design, product documentation, feedback loops, and communication about the value and limitations of the technology. 

To help developers ensure their products are designed with consideration of all the people they could impact, we’re launching a toolkit of Responsible Innovation Practices based on our own experiences developing AI inside of Microsoft. We’re including these two best practices and are adding more for you in the coming months.
Use the links in this table to learn more about applying the best practices to your technology development scenarios:


## [Harms Modeling](./harms-modeling/index.md)

*Harms Modeling* is a framework for product teams, grounded in four core pillars that examine how people's lives can be negatively impacted by technology: injuries, denial of consequential services, infringement on human rights, and erosion of democratic & societal structures. Similar to *Security Threat Modeling*, Harms Modeling enables product teams to anticipate potential real-world impacts of technology, which is a cornerstone of responsible development.

## [Community Jury](./community-jury/index.md)

An adaptation of the [citizen jury](https://jefferson-center.org/about-us/how-we-work/), *Community Jury* is a technique that brings together diverse stakeholders impacted by a technology. The stakeholders are provided an opportunity to learn from experts about a project, deliberate together, and give feedback on use cases and product design. This technique allows project teams to collaborate with researchers to identify stakeholder values and understand the perceptions and concerns of impacted stakeholders.
