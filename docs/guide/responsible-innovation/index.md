# Responsible Innovation: A Best Practices Toolkit

The Best Practices Toolkit provides developers with a framework and best practice for anticipating and addressing the potential negative impacts of technology on people at various stages of the development lifecycle.  Built from insights and learnings in the development of AI solutions within Microsoft, this guidance is part of a broader set of practices in use that we will continue to share as they mature.

## Judgement call

*Judgment Call* is an award-winning game and team-based activity that puts Microsoftâ€™s AI principles of fairness, privacy and security, reliability and safety, transparency, inclusion, and accountability into action. The game provides an easy-to-use method for cultivating stakeholder empathy through scenario-imagining. Game participants write product reviews from the perspective of a particular stakeholder, describing what kind of impact and harms the technology could produce from their point of view.

## Harms Modeling

[Harms Modeling](./harms-modeling/index.md) is a framework for product teams, grounded in four core pillars that examine how people's lives can be negatively impacted by technology: injuries, denial of consequential services, infringement on human rights, and erosion of democratic & societal structures. Similar to *Security Threat Modeling*, Harms Modeling enables product teams to anticipate potential real-world impacts of technology, which is a cornerstone of responsible development.

## Community Jury

[Community Jury](./community-jury/index.md) is a technique that brings together diverse stakeholders impacted by a technology. It is an adaptation of the [citizen jury](https://jefferson-center.org/about-us/how-we-work/). The stakeholders are provided an opportunity to learn from experts about a project, deliberate together, and give feedback on use cases and product design. This technique allows project teams to collaborate with researchers to identify stakeholder values and understand the perceptions and concerns of impacted stakeholders.
