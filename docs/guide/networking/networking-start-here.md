Azure provides a wide range of networking tools and capabilities. These are just some of the key networking services available in Azure:

- [Azure Application Gateway](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/application-gateway). Build secure, scalable, highly available web front ends.
- [Azure ExpressRoute](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/expressroute). Experience a fast, reliable, and private connection to Azure.
- [Azure Firewall](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/azure-firewall). Use a cloud-native, next-generation firewall to provide protection for your Azure Virtual Network resources.
- [Azure Load Balancer](https://azure.microsoft.com/products/azure-load-balancing). Deliver high availability and network performance to your apps.
- [Azure Private Link](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/private-link). Enable private access to services that are hosted on the Azure platform while keeping your data on the Microsoft network.
- [Azure Virtual Network](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/virtual-network). Provision private networks, and optionally connect to on-premises datacenters.
- [Azure Virtual WAN](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/virtual-wan). Optimize and automate branch-to-branch connectivity through Azure.
- [Azure VPN Gateway](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/vpn-gateway). Establish secure, cross-premises connectivity.

## Introduction to networking on Azure
If you're new to networking on Azure, the best way to learn more is with [Microsoft Learn](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/?WT.mc_id=learnaka), a free online training platform. Microsoft Learn provides interactive training for Microsoft products and more.

Here's a good introduction: 
- [Explore Azure networking services](/learn/modules/azure-networking-fundamentals)

And here's a comprehensive learning path: 
- [Configure and manage virtual networks for Azure administrators](/learn/paths/azure-administrator-manage-virtual-networks)

## Path to production

- [Azure Firewall architecture overview](/azure/architecture/example-scenario/firewalls) 
- [Azure Private Link in a hub-and-spoke network](/azure/architecture/guide/networking/private-link-hub-spoke-network)
- [Build solutions with availability zones](/azure/architecture/high-availability/building-solutions-for-high-availability)
