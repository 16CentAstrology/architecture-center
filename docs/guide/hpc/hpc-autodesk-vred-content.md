Autodesk VRED Overview

Autodesk VRED is a 3D visualization software which helps Automotive Designers and Engineers create product presentations, design reviews and virtual prototypes using interactive CPU and GPU ray tracing. Autodesk VRED, which was previously limited to CPU, now leverages GPU technology to support the high demands of consumers and provide interactive ray tracing and AI-powered Denoising. This allows users to gain immediate visual feedback to see how a vehicleâ€™s aesthetics will interact with different environments in real time

Autodesk VRED enables users to create digital prototypes so they can gain insight into how vehicles will look and perform. To be effective in guiding design decisions, the digital prototypes need to look and behave as close as possible to the real thing
