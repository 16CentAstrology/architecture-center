## Why deploy HALO AI on Azure?
-	Simplifies migration to the cloud
-	Optimizes the workload in these ways….
-	Can be rapidly provisioned
-	Performance

## Architecture

### Components

## Compute sizing and drivers

### Required drivers
<Information about any specialized drivers required for the recommended sizes. List the specific size and link it to the appropriate page in the VM sizes documentation – for example: https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-machines/nda100-v4-series>

## HALO AI installation
Before you install <Workload>, you need to deploy and connect a VM and install the required NVIDIA and AMD drivers.
 Important – if needed
<if needed – for example: NVIDIA Fabric Manager installation is required for VMs that use NVLink or NVSwitch.>
For information about deploying the VM and installing the drivers, see one of these articles:
•	Run a Windows VM on Azure
•	Run a Linux VM on Azure

<Must include a sentence or two to outline the installation context along with link/s (no internal links, it must be official/accessible) to install information of the product docs for the workload solution.>
<Should not list any ordered steps of installation.> 
<Workload> performance results
<Give a short intro to how performance was tested>
<Results for X>
<Results for Y etc>

Additional notes about tests
<Include any additional notes about the testing process used.>

## Azure cost
<Description of the costs that might be associated with running this workload in Azure. Make sure to have a link to the Azure pricing calculator.>
You can use the Azure pricing calculator, to estimate the costs for your configuration.
<Show the pricing calculation or a direct link to this specific workload with the configuration(s) used.>
