This article briefly describes the steps for running Altair Radioss on a virtual machine (VM) that's deployed on Azure. It also presents the performance results of running Radioss on Azure.
Radioss is a multidisciplinary finite-element solver for linear and non-linear problems.  Itâ€™s used to predict crash response, dynamic, transient-loading effects on vehicles, structures, and other products. Radioss:
- Uses battery and module macro models for crash events, road debris impacts, and shocks to simulate mechanical failures that cause electrical short circuits, thermal runaway, and risk of fire.
- Provides a composite shell element with delamination tracking and a fast parabolic tetra element.
- Implements extensive material laws and rupture criteria for crack propagation in brittle materials like windshields.
- Provides a fast solution for airbag deployment that uses finite volume method technology.
Radioss is used across industry sectors to provide multiphysics solutions to dynamic problems combining structures, mechanisms, fluids, thermal, and electromagnetic effects.
