This article briefly explains the steps to run ADS CFD Code Leo application on a Virtual Machine deployed in Azure Cloud Platform and presents the performance results. Learn more about ADS CFD at [ADS CFD Inc. (aerodynamic-solutions.com)](https://new.aerodynamic-solutions.com).

The ADS CFD flow solver, Code Leo, is a URANS-based flow solver that delivers both accurate and fast flow simulations for general flow configurations
- It is a density-based, compressible flow code, with explicit time-marching, and convergence acceleration.
- It is second order accurate in time and space with low numerical smoothing
- It is used to run both the steady-state and unsteady simulations
- It can handle both structured multi-block meshes and unstructured meshes with mixed tetrahedrons, pyramids, prisms and hex elements.
- It allows use of various turbomachinery rotor/stator interaction models including the sliding mesh, mixing plane and frozen rotor models.

Originally designed for CPUs, ADS CFD has extended it to take advantage of the advanced GPU architecture following the advent of cost-effective GPUs. The methods used have been validated over multiple decades by industry leaders including AFRL, and NASA. Code Leo allows users to switch easily between CPU and GPU solvers.
 
The ADS CFD software is used primarily in the aerospace and turbomachinery industries for performance and durability assessments of jet engines and aircraft. One of the main use cases is the analysis and optimization of the integrated engine/aircraft configurations so that next generation aircraft designs can be closed on time and with confidence

Prior to installing the ADS CFD Code Leo application, youâ€™ll need to deploy and connect a virtual machine, and install the required NVIDIA and AMD drivers.

Performance results of Code Leo on Azure virtual machine
ADS CFD CODE LEO OVERVIEW

The ADS CFD flow solver, Code Leo, was used to run both the steady state and unsteady simulations. Code Leo is a density-based, compressible flow code, with explicit time marching, and convergence acceleration. Code Leo handles both structured multi-block meshes and unstructured meshes with mixed tetrahedrons, pyramids, prisms and hex elements. Code Leo allows use of various turbomachinery rotor/stator interaction models including the sliding mesh, mixing plane and frozen rotor models. Code Leo is HPC-aware and uses MPI+MP for parallel computing.

Code Leo can be executed on both CPUs and GPUs. Originally designed for CPUs, ADS CFD has extended it to take advantage of the advanced GPU architecture following the advent of cost-effective GPUs. Code Leo allows users to switch easily between CPU and GPU solvers.

ADS CFD CODE LEO V8.21.08 PERFORMANCE RESULTS

**Model Details:**
For performance evaluation, the CC3 wheel model is considered. The CC3 wheel model has two parts: the Impeller and Diffuser.

**CC3 wheel: Impeller and Diffuser**

|MODEL  |NUMBER OF ELEMENTS |NUMBER OF NODES  |
|---------|---------|---------|
|Impeller     |   670848      |     742968    |
|Diffuser     |     914688    |     1012095    |

Full wheel time accurate analysis results are carried out on Azure virtual machines ND96asr_v4 and NC24s_v3 respectively.

ADS CFD provided CPU results, which is used as baseline to compare GPU runs on both VM instances.

The elapsed time for CPU simulation is 3600 minutes, which was carried out on server with Xeon 23 CPUs, clock speed of 2.4 GHz.

Pricing 

The application installation time not considered for Azure cost calculation, only model run time (wall clock time) considered for cost calculation. Please note following calculation is indicative, the actuals would depend on the model size.

For the cost estimate, [Azure calculator](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/calculator) can be used for the required configuration.
