This document briefly explains the steps to install and run Autodesk Revit application on a virtual machine (VM) in Azure and presents the performance results. Revit software helps architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) teams create high-quality buildings and infrastructure.

Engineers uses Revit to model shapes, structures, and systems in 3D with parametric accuracy, precision, and streamline documentation work with instant revisions to plans, elevations, schedules, and section as projects change. 

Revit has built-in automation for documenting design and managing deliverables. It saves, syncs, and shares model-based BIM and CAD data to connect multidisciplinary teams and workflows. Revit is use as the data backbone of your BIM process. Develop and deploy standards, workflows, and content.
