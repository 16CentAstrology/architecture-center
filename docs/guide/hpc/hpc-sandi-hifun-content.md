This article briefly describes the steps for running [Sandiâ€™s](https://sandi.co.in)  HiFUN application on a virtual machine (VM) that's deployed on Azure. It also presents the performance results of running HiFUN on Azure.

HiFUN is a  general purpose Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) software.

HiFUNis capable of simulating airflow over flying configurations, automobiles as well as structures such as buildings, ships etc. HiFUN:

- Provides robust, fast, and accurate solver providing aerodynamic design data in an attractive turnaround time.
- Employs unstructured cell center finite volume method capable of handling complex geometries and complicated flow physics in a typical industry environment.
- Handles MPI directives for parallel computing on distributed memory HPC.
- Provides the ability to scale over several thousands of processor cores
- Uses [OpenACC](https://www.openacc.org) constructs  for porting HiFUN onto NVIDIA GPUs for parallel computing using hybrid HPC platform

Sandi HiFUN is  majorly used in Aerospace, Automotive, Industrial and Wind/Turbine industries.

To test the performance of Sandi HiFUN on Azure Platform [HBv3-Series](/azure/virtual-machines/hbv3-series) virtual machines and [NC64as_T4_v3](/azure/virtual-machines/nct4-v3-series) virtual machines are deployed.

## Why deploy HiFUN on Azure?

- Modern and diverse compute options to meet your workload's needs
- The flexibility of virtualization without the need to buy and maintain physical hardware
- Rapid provisioning

### Required drivers

To use InfiniBand, you need to enable [InfiniBand drivers](/azure/virtual-machines/workloads/hpc/enable-infiniband).

To take advantage of the GPU capabilities of [NCasT4_v3](/azure/virtual-machines/nct4-v3-series) VMs, you need to install NVIDIA GPU drivers.

## HiFUN installation

Before you install HiFUN, you need to deploy and connect a VM For information about deploying the VM and installing the drivers, see one of these articles:

- [Run a Windows VM on Azure](/azure/architecture/reference-architectures/n-tier/windows-vm)
- [Run a Linux VM on Azure](/azure/architecture/reference-architectures/n-tier/linux-vm)

## Azure cost

Only model running time (wall clock time) is considered for these cost calculations. Application installation time isn't considered. The calculations are indicative. The actual numbers depend on the size of the model.

You can use the [Azure pricing calculator](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/calculator) to estimate costs for your configuration.

The following tables provide elapsed times in hours. To compute the total cost, multiply by the Azure VM hourly cost, which you can find [here for Windows](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/virtual-machines/windows/#pricing) and here for [Linux](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/virtual-machines/linux/#pricing).
