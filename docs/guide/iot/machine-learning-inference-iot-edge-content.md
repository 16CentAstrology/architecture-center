Background

One of the most popular Edge scenarios is the artificial intelligence (AI) on Edge scenario (Image Classification, Object Detection, Body, Face & Gesture Analysis, Image Manipulation, ETC ...). Azure IoT Edge can certainly support these scenarios. This AI ability can also be improved over the model update step, but in some scenarios the Edge device network environment is not good, especially for some manufacturing equipment such as wind power or oil exploitation which are equipped in the desert or in the sea.

However, as you know, Azure IoT Edge Module is the basis on docker. In general, an Edge module image with the AI environment which size will be around GB level at least, so how to incremental updates the AI model in a narrow bandwidth network it becomes more meaningful. That's why this document was written. The idea is to make an Edge AI loader module which can load Object Detection TensorFlow or ONNX AI models and enable this AI module as a Web API. So that in this way Edge module can benefit other application or module.

So, the solutions in this article can help you from 4 different ways
- Enables the AI Inference capability on Edge devices
- Minimize the network cost of deploying and updating AI models on the Edge. Especially in the narrow bandwidth network environment, it can greatly save resources for you or your customers.
- You can create and manage AI model repository in IoT edge device local storage.
- When edge device switches AI models, you can achieve almost zero down time.

Overview

This document can help you build an Azure IoT Edge Module that can download AI model then enable Inference ability. support TensorFlow *.tflite format model or *.onnx (Open Neural Network Exchange) format model.

So, for ML Inference Modules have some Key concepts that need to be clarified first (If you are not familiar with AI, you can learn the basics knowledge of TensorFlow lite and ONNX in the following two sections).

TensorFlow

1.	AI Model File: *.tflite its pre-trained AI model which download from [TensorFlow.org - Download starter model with Metadata](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/examples/object_detection/overview) and it is a generic AI model format that can be used in cross-platform applications such as iOS and Android. Fore more information about Metadata and associated fields (eg: labels.txt) see [Read the metadata from models](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/models/convert/metadata#read_the_metadata_from_models)
2.	Model descriptionï¼š An object detection model is trained to detect the presence and location of multiple classes of objects. For example, a model might be trained with images that contain various pieces of fruit, along with a label that specifies the class of fruit they represent (e.g. an apple, a banana, or a strawberry), and data specifying where each object appears in the image.
When an image is subsequently provided to the model, it will output a list of the objects it detects, the location of a bounding box that contains each object, and a score that indicates the confidence that detection was correct.
3.	In case of if you want to build or custome tune an AI Model, please see [TensorFlow Lite Model Maker](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/models/modify/model_maker)
4.	More free pre-trained detection models with a variety of latency and precision characteristics can be found in the [Detection Zoo](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/object_detection/g3doc/tf1_detection_zoo.md#mobile-models). Each one of them follows the input and output signatures described in the following sections.

Open Neural Network Exchange (ONNX)

Open Neural Network Exchange (ONNX) is an open standard format for representing machine learning models. ONNX is supported by a community of partners who have implemented it in many frameworks and tools.

1.	ONNX supports a variety of tools to Build and deploy models and Frameworks & Converters [Build / Deploy Model](https://onnx.ai/supported-tools.html)
2.	You can use ONNX runtime run ONNX Pre-Trained Models [ONNX Model Zoo](https://github.com/onnx/models) for implementation Vision Language Other AI features
3.	In this case you can use model of [Object Detection & Image Segmentation - Tiny YOLOv3](https://github.com/onnx/models/tree/main/vision/object_detection_segmentation/tiny-yolov3)

The ONNX community [provides tools](https://onnx.ai/supported-tools.html) to assist with creating and deploying your next deep learning model.

The dynamically loaded AI model is based on the features of IoT Edge module Twin, the architecture please refer below and work steps:

Comments:

1.	You can download pre-trained AI models from TensorFlow [Detection Zoo](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/object_detection/g3doc/tf1_detection_zoo.md#mobile-models) or [ONNX Model Zoo](https://github.com/onnx/models), or you can also use your own AI model maybe it was built by AML. Then upload Pre-Trained AI Models to public blob storage (Or any other Web service, just for the Edge Module can access this resource and download to Edge device later. You can also consider private endpoint connections between blob storage and Edge device if you need better security.)
2.	The IoT Hub will sync device module twins automatically with AI Models information, the sync will be done even if IoT Edge was offline for some time(In some cases, IoT devices are connected to networks at scheduled times (hourly, daily or weekly) to save power or network traffic).
3.	The Loader Module monitors the updates of module twins via SDK. Through this way, it can get the ML model SAS token, and then download the AI model. 
    - [Create SAS token for a container or blob](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/storage/blobs/sas-service-create?tabs=dotnet)
    - The **ExpiresOn** property allows you to set the access time of resources. If your device will offline for a long time, you can extend the expiration time.
4.	The Loader Module saves the AI model in the shared local storage of the IoT Edge Module. The shared local storage needs to be configured in the IoT Edge deployment JSON file.
5.	The Loader Module loads the AI model from the local storage by TensorFlow/ONNX SDK.
6.	The Loader Module starts a Web API that receives the binary photo via post request and returns results in json file

In case for update AI model we can upload new AI model to blob storage and sync device module twins again instead of update whole IoT Edge module image, so this is the AI model incremental updates.

Download trained AI model

Here I recommend using device twin to receive notifications that a new model is ready. Even when the device is offline, the message can still be cached in the IoT Hub to wait for the Edge device to come back, and the message will be automatically synchronized.

Here is a code example of the python code used to register notifications for device twin then download AI model as a zip package. And perform further operations on the downloaded file.

1.	The device twin notification was received, which included the file name (File name You can include version information such as 1.0, 1.1, or 2.0), file download address, and MD5 authentication token.
2.	Download AI model as zip file to local storage.
3.	MD5 checksum (optional) MD5 verification prevents zip files that have been tampered with in network transmission.
4.	Unzip it and save it locally.
5.	Send notifications to IoT Hub or routing message to inform that the new AI model is ready.

Inference Procedure

After the download of the AI model the next step is to use the model on the Edge device, we can dynamically load and Object Detection on Edge devices. The following code can help us use the TensorFlow AI model to do Object Detection on Edge device.
1.	Dynamic load TensorFlow flite AI MODEL.
2.	Image standardization.
3.	Object detection
4.	Detection scores for the result

```
class InferenceProcedure():
    
    def detect_object(self, imgBytes):

        results = []
        try:
            model_full_path = AI_Model_Path.Get_Model_Path()
            if(model_full_path == ""):
                raise Exception ("PLEASE SET AI MODEL FIRST")
            if '.tflite' in model_full_path:
                interpreter = tf.lite.Interpreter(model_path=model_full_path)
                interpreter.allocate_tensors()
                input_details = interpreter.get_input_details()
                output_details = interpreter.get_output_details()
                input_shape = input_details[0]['shape']

                # bytes to numpy.ndarray
                im_arr = np.frombuffer(imgBytes, dtype=np.uint8)
                img = cv2.imdecode(im_arr, flags=cv2.IMREAD_COLOR)
                im_rgb = cv2.cvtColor(img, cv2.COLOR_BGR2RGB)
                im_rgb = cv2.resize(im_rgb, (input_shape[1], input_shape[2]))
                input_data = np.expand_dims(im_rgb, axis=0)

                interpreter.set_tensor(input_details[0]['index'], input_data)
                interpreter.invoke()
                output_data = interpreter.get_tensor(output_details[0]['index'])
                detection_boxes = interpreter.get_tensor(output_details[0]['index'])
                detection_classes = interpreter.get_tensor(output_details[1]['index'])
                detection_scores = interpreter.get_tensor(output_details[2]['index'])
                num_boxes = interpreter.get_tensor(output_details[3]['index'])

                label_names = [line.rstrip('\n') for line in open(AI_Model_Path.Get_Labelmap_Path())]
                label_names = np.array(label_names)
                new_label_names = list(filter(lambda x : x != '???', label_names))

                for i in range(int(num_boxes[0])):
                    if detection_scores[0, i] > .5:
                        class_id = int(detection_classes[0, i])
                        class_name = new_label_names[class_id]
                        # top,	left,	bottom,	right

                        results.append(results_json)

            raise

        # return results

```
For the ONNX version the process steps are exactly the same, here is the sample code for ONNX, the only difference is how to handle scores result, because the Labelmap and model output parameters are different.

```

Well, if your IoT Edge Device incorporates the above code and features, then congratulations, your Edge device has AI image object detection capability and supports dynamic updating of AI models. So next, if you want the Edge module to be able to provide AI ability to other applications or modules as Web API then you can create a Web API in your module.

Flask framework, for example, allows you to build an API quickly. You can receive images as binary then use AI model for detection and return results in json format.
