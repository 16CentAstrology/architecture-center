Contoso is a broadcast media company responsible for airing broadcasts and commentary on Olympic events. In addition, Contoso provides reliable event transcription both for accessibility and data mining purposes as part of the broadcast agreement. 

Contoso seeks to provide live subtitling and audio transcription for Olympic events using the Azure Speech service. However, it is important to note that Contoso employs diverse commentators worldwide, representing different genders and accents. In addition, each event has specific terminology that can make transcription difficult.
