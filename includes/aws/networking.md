| Area | AWS service | Azure service | Description |
| -----| ----------- | ------------- | ----------- |
| Cloud virtual networking | [Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)](https://aws.amazon.com/vpc) | [Virtual Network](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/virtual-network) | Provides an isolated, private environment in the cloud. Users have control over their virtual networking environment, including selection of their own IP address range, creation of subnets, and configuration of route tables and network gateways. With AWS, each subnet must reside in one availability zone (AZ). In Azure, subnets can span multiple AZs. |
| NAT gateways | [NAT Gateways](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-nat-gateway.html) | [Virtual Network NAT](/azure/virtual-network/nat-gateway/nat-overview) |A service that simplifies outbound-only Internet connectivity for virtual networks. When configured on a subnet, all outbound connectivity uses your specified static public IP addresses. Outbound connectivity is possible without a load balancer or public IP addresses directly attached to virtual machines. NAT Gateways can only be associated with a single public IP, where VNATS can have multiple public IPs |
| Cross-premises connectivity | [VPN Gateway](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpn/latest/s2svpn/VPC_VPN.html) | [VPN Gateway](/azure/vpn-gateway/vpn-gateway-about-vpngateways) |AWS VPN Gateway and Azure VPN Gateway offer secure and reliable VPN connections with high availability and support for industry-standard protocols. The key differences lie in their integration with other cloud services and specific features like route-based and policy-based VPNs in Azure. AWS VPN offers a maximum of 5 Gb/s throughput whereas Azure offers up to 10 Gb/s. |
| DNS management | [Route 53](https://aws.amazon.com/route53) | [DNS](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/dns/) | Manage your DNS records using the same credentials and billing and support contract as your other Azure services. Both services support DNSSEC. |
| DNS-based routing | [Route 53](https://aws.amazon.com/route53) | [Traffic Manager](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/traffic-manager) | A service that hosts domain names, plus routes users to Internet applications, connects user requests to datacenters, manages traffic to apps, and improves app availability with automatic failover. |
Dedicated network | [Direct Connect](https://aws.amazon.com/directconnect) | [ExpressRoute](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/expressroute) | Establishes a dedicated, private network connection from a location to the cloud provider (not over the Internet). |
| Load balancing | [Network Load Balancer](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/network/introduction.html) | [Load Balancer](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/load-balancer)  | Azure Load Balancer load balances traffic at layer 4 (TCP or UDP). Standard Load Balancer also supports cross-region or global load balancing. |
| Application-level load balancing |  [Application Load Balancer](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/application/introduction.html) | [Application Gateway](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/application-gateway) | Application Gateway is a layer 7 load balancer. It supports SSL termination, cookie-based session affinity, and round robin for load-balancing traffic. AAG provides additional features like multi-site routing and security features. |
| Route table | [Custom Route Tables](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_Route_Tables.html) | [User Defined Routes](/azure/virtual-network/virtual-networks-udr-overview) | Custom, or user-defined (static) routes to override default system routes, or to add more routes to a subnet's route table. |
| Private link | [PrivateLink](https://aws.amazon.com/privatelink) | [Azure Private Link](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/private-link) | Azure Private Link provides private access to services that are hosted on the Azure platform. This keeps your data on the Microsoft network. |
| Private PaaS connectivity |  [VPC endpoints](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/privatelink/vpc-endpoints.html) | [Private Endpoint](/azure/private-link/private-endpoint-overview) | Private Endpoint provides secured, private connectivity to various Azure platform as a service (PaaS) resources, over a backbone Microsoft private network. |
| Virtual network peering | [VPC Peering](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/peering/what-is-vpc-peering.html) | [VNET Peering](/azure/virtual-network/virtual-network-peering-overview) | VNet peering is a mechanism that connects two virtual networks (VNets) in the same region through the Azure backbone network. Once peered, the two virtual networks appear as one for all connectivity purposes. |
| Content delivery networks | [CloudFront](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront)| [Front Door](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/frontdoor) | Azure Front Door is a modern cloud content delivery network (CDN) service that delivers high performance, scalability, and secure user experiences for your content and applications. |
| Network Monitoring | [VPC Flow Logs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/flow-logs.html) | [Azure Network Watcher](/azure/network-watcher/network-watcher-monitoring-overview) | Azure Network Watcher allows you to monitor, diagnose, and analyze the traffic in Azure Virtual Network. |
| Virtual Network Peering | [AWS Transit Gateway](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/tgw/tgw-transit-gateways.html) | [Azure Virtual WAN](/azure/virtual-wan/) | Simplifies and enhances network connectivity across multiple environments, supporting scalable and flexible network architectures. Azure Virtual WAN integrates with Azure Firewall and DDoS Protection, offering additional security features. AWS Transit Gateway relies on AWS security services like AWS Shield and AWS WAF. Azure Virtual WAN is designed for global connectivity, making it easier to connect branch offices and remote users worldwide. AWS Transit Gateway: 100 BGP prefixes per private connection. Azure Virtual WAN Private peering: 1,000 BGP prefixes. |
| Cloud Virtual Networking | [AWS Global Accelerator](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/tgw/tgw-transit-gateways.html) | [Azure Traffic Manager](/azure/traffic-manager/traffic-manager-overview) | Improves the availability and performance of your applications with global routing and traffic management. |
| Cross-premises connectivity | [AWS Direct Connect Gateway](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/directconnect/latest/UserGuide/direct-connect-gateways-intro.html) | [Azure ExpressRoute Global Reach](/azure/expressroute/expressroute-global-reach) | Extends your on-premises networks to the cloud with dedicated, private connections that span multiple regions. |
| Application level networking | [AWS App Mesh](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/app-mesh/latest/userguide/what-is-app-mesh.html) | [Azure ExpressRoute Global Reach](/azure/service-fabric/) | Provides application-level networking to manage microservices, including service discovery, load balancing, and traffic routing. |
| Service Discovery | [AWS Cloud Map](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloud-map/latest/dg/what-is-cloud-map.html) | [Azure Private DNS](/azure/dns/private-dns-overview) | Service discovery for cloud resources, allowing you to register any application resources and dynamically update their locations. |
