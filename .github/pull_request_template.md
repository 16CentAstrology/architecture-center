## Before you create your pull request

1. If your pull request is associated with an Azure DevOps work item, enter the URL here: 

2. If your pull request is related to a contributor success work item, please prefix the PR title accordingly. For work related to:
   - new/updated content that originated from the contributor pipeline process (including freshness updates), use "Pipeline: "
   - maintenance activities such as edit passes, art improvements, or template alignment, use "Edit Pass: "

3. Do not update an article's `ms.date` metadata property unless you've done a full freshness review of the content. A full freshness review includes changes required to correct or improve the **full** technical accuracy of the article. Do not update `ms.date` if you're doing targeted changes to improve non-technical aspects of the article, such as the editorial quality, art improvements, article template alignment, etc. 

## After initial #sign-off of your pull request

Once you've completed your PR and you or a peer has done the initial `#sign-off`, please note that your PR may be selected for review by the Cloud Architecture Content Team (CACT). Following CACT review, you may receive questions or requests for additional changes. Once the CACT review process is complete, a `CACT #sign-off` will be added which triggers the final review by the PR review team.

You should have initial feedback from CACT review within 1 business day. If you have an urgent request or need to contact the team, please mention `@MicrosoftDocs/cloud-architecture-content-team-pr-reviewers` in your PR and someone will get back to you.
