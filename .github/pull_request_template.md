## Tips and additional instructions

### ms.date metadata considerations

- Don't update an article's "ms.date" metadata property unless you've done a **full freshness review** of the content. A full freshness review includes changes required to correct or improve the **full** technical accuracy of the article. 
- Don't update "ms.date" if you're doing targeted changes to improve non-technical aspects of the article, such as the editorial quality, art improvements, article template alignment, etc. 
- If you've changed any "ms.date" properties for work that wasn't part of full review for freshness, please reset them to their previous value.

### Signaling when you're ready for your changes to be reviewed and merged

After you've completed your proposed changes, addressed build warnings, and had some peers review, congrats. That's a big milestone. You can now begin the sign-off process for review and merge:

1. If your PR was in draft mode, remove "[WIP]" from the title and select the **Ready for review** button at the bottom of the PR.
2. Enter "#sign-off" in a new comment. This comment indicates that **you're confident the work meets or exceeds Microsoft's standards for publication**, and will trigger the review process. 
3. Your PR may be selected for initial review by the **Cloud Architecture Content Team (CACT)**. Following CACT review, you may receive questions or requests for additional changes. You should have initial feedback from CACT review within a few business days. If you have an urgent request or need to contact the team, please mention `@MicrosoftDocs/cloud-architecture-content-team-pr-reviewers` in your PR and someone will get back to you.
4. Once the CACT review process is complete, a `CACT #sign-off` will be added which triggers the final review/merge by the PR review team.
